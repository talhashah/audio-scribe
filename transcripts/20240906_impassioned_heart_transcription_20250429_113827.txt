The ultimate expression of Islam is not some laundry list of things that we shouldn't do. but we should do not some laundry list of things that we should do and list of things that we shouldn't do. Rather, Islam is an expression of how a person can achieve proximity to Allah. Once a person falls in love with Allah, Spanawata Allah, and wants to achieve proximity to Allah and recognizes that, أنني أخذت بإمكاني أن أخذ one great opportunity and existence to be able to connect with Allah, then of course the person is going to do everything in their power to be able to gain that proximity and is also going to do everything in their power if they recognize it's something distances them from Allah. So this has to be the driving force. And the other thing that we discussed last week is how does a person achieve that. Where does that come from? How can a person have that passion in their heart? And we mentioned a couple things. Number one, obviously I think everybody in this room will appreciate, but it's worth repeating that passion arises in the heart. So this is a function of the heart. It's not a function of the mind. I can academically, you know, we all experience this all the time. We academically understand all the things that we should do. We academically understand all the things that we should avoid. Sometimes we have great, great, great, great knowledge of lots of details of our deen. But that spark is lacking and that spark is actually what's the deen. So how does it arise? It doesn't arise in the mind. It arises in the heart. When that passion comes into the heart, then a person will be driven to love Allah, and to achieve high status in both this life and the next. And we also briefly mentioned that what's the mechanism to achieve that? So the mechanism to achieve that is very simple, meaning that all you have to appreciate is that it is the nature of the heart to get attracted to things. This is the quality which Allah's Allah has placed in the heart. The heart is designed to love and the limbs are subservient to the heart. Once the heart falls in love with something, it's, first of all, you have to be exposed to it, and the second second of all, it has to enter the heart. Once the heart falls in love with something, the limbs and the mind will follow. You see people who love basketball. You'll see the way they walk. You can tell they walk like a basketball, they're not even a basketball player. They walk how the players walk, and they dress how the players dress, and they actually talk the way that the players talk. They know places only through the world of basketball. I was speaking with someone, and I said, have you ever heard of this place? I said, I feel like I heard this name before. I said, well, how would you have heard this name? I said, oh, actually, I remember this NBA player has actually been here before, and so I've heard the name of this place before. What do you mean? NBA player? How do you know where the NBA players go? The NBA players play basketball. They don't go to this place. It's said, no, no, no, it's not that to say play basketball. We follow them on Instagram and stuff, and they tell us everything that they do in the off season, and I know that one basketball player ate in this city. So I know the name of this city. I was shocked. But where is that coming from? It's coming because the person has a heart. They were exposed to basketball. They became so enamored and enthralled by basketball that they not only follow basketball, but they follow what the players do off season where they eat their dinner outside of the season of basketball. Where is that coming from? It's not coming because their parents told them to do that. That's coming because it entered into the heart, and the heart is designed to love. Once the heart becomes impassioned or ignited with something, then it's going to completely become engrossed in that thing. Now, all of us, have been given two big blessings. All of us have been given two big blessings. The first is time. Everybody has time. I'm not saying you have free time. I'm just saying everybody's been given time. And we choose how we want to use that time. We choose whether we're going to use that time in order to do A, B, C, D. We have relative flexibility. Of course, there's needs. We have to work. We have to go to school, etc. But we've all been given time, and this is something that's democratized, meaning that every single person in the planet has time. And the second is that we've all been given a heart. And I'm not talking about the physical heart. The physical heart pumps blood. Everybody has a physical heart. I'm talking about the spiritual heart. Everyone's been given a spiritual heart. We choose what we let into this heart. It comes empty. When a person's born, they don't fall. They don't know what music is. They don't know what the NBA is. They don't know what this designer brand is. They don't know what, I don't know, baking is the heart's empty. We expose ourselves to things. Or we're exposed to things. Those things enter into the heart. And when they enter into the heart, they ignite a passion. And it's those passions that drive us. So it's two things. It's exposure. And it's two essentially one thing, but two pieces, exposure to the heart. I've given this example before, but look, there's probably some really popular movie in South Korea. Nobody in this room cares. Nobody thinks about South Korean movies. But all of South Korea is probably going crazy over the latest movie that just came out in South Korea. Why? Because they're exposed to it. We're not exposed to it. We're exposed to something different. So it's not like you automatically fall in love with South Korean film. Although maybe somebody follows that. It's that you get exposed to something and enters into the heart. When it enters into the heart, then people react to that. So we all have a heart. And the challenge for every one of us is to ensure that what comes into the heart is the love of Allah. Now, number two, we all have a heart. Number two, it's important to appreciate that this heart doesn't have the ability to this heart doesn't accept partners. Let's put it that way. The heart doesn't accept partners. The heart's usually going to be passionate about one, maybe maximum two things. The heart doesn't have the ability to be passionate about 10 things. It has limited ability to be passionate about something. We choose what we expose it to. And when we expose it, it picks up on a couple things. Usually because our friends talk about it or because we're exposed to it in our society or our knuffs is also kind of like potentiating some of the desires that we have which then get embedded into the heart. And once those get into the heart, that becomes the pursuit of the human being. More broadly speaking, people have affinity towards two things. Either it's themselves or it's Allah. That you can kind of separate this broadly. Now, what do I mean themselves? Either it's their own entertainment. You call it food, call it the NBA, call it whatever you want. It's their own personal entertainment. They enjoy something, they entertain themselves with it. And this is what drives them, wakes them up in the morning and puts them to bed at night. And it's the thing that they're constantly churning in their mind and heart. Or they appreciate the greater reality, which is that this world is a distraction. And I don't need to entertain myself. I need to embed my heart with the love of Allah. How does a person achieve that degree of love of Allah? It all boils down to hijab. And I also mentioned this last week, which is that there's this concept in our dean called hijab. It is a physical concept that has legal ramifications that we talk about all the time. But actually, it's a spiritual concept as well. Spirituality, what do we mean by hijab? The heart is designed to become impassioned. The heart is designed to experience passion. And hijab is the mechanism by which we protect those things from coming into the heart that will trip us up in this world so that the heart can become full of the love of Allah. What does that mean? It means that we lower our gaze from not only the opposite gender, which that's one aspect of hijab. But we lower our gaze from everything that would distract us from Allah. That's the spiritual hijab. Now, I mean, we can claim immunity by thinking that I can expose myself to anything. It's fine. My dean will thrive. But that's not possible. And our own personal experience shows us that it's not possible. People think it's not a big deal. I sit on the phone and I scroll through shoes and clothes and hairstyles. It doesn't affect me. Of course, it affects you. It goes into the heart because the eyes are a pathway to the heart. Once you start doing this, you flip through and then you kind of a few ideas get planted in the mind. Then you go out into society. You see people wearing those shoes and these shoes and these clothes and dressing this way. And then you go back on and you scroll again. And then every season they change the clothes. Every year they change the styles. This just gets embedded within the heart. Now you start, you know, it's perfectly fine to carry this. But now I need to carry that. It's perfectly fine to walk in this shoe. But now I need to walk in that. My clothes and my closet are fine. But now I need to dress like that. I've got enough clothes for a village in my closet. But I need one more because I'm not contented. My desires are not satiated. Where is this coming from? This is coming from the heart. And that's because we constantly expose ourselves to these things. How is it that when somebody wants to get a house and the deal doesn't work out, they're crying for three days. For three days people are crying. More than that sometimes. I put an offer. I can't believe it. I'm so frustrated. My house didn't get, you know, this house didn't go through for me. And even get to get to the bigger extreme. Then they say, Allah didn't answer my dua. No, ala bila. Like Allah, like you're supposed to tell Allah which house you're supposed to get. I mean, who's the God and who's the servant? Like, we're telling people tell me, come to me and they say, I made dua, I didn't get this thing. Are you God or are you making dua to Allah? When you make dua to Allah, you're asking Allah to give you what's best. You're not telling Allah to give me this house otherwise my dua wasn't accepted. But where does this crazy notion come from? It comes because we've embedded these things in our hearts and minds. We're talking up with one another, where each person lives and what they purchase. And then we sit in the Zillow all day and we get the alerts. We don't miss one second. And all this stuff gets embedded and it just trashes the heart. And then that's what drives us. And then that's what drives the tears. Where are the tears coming from? The eyes, and it's not from the mind. It's coming from the heart. The heart's broken. So now it's the tears are flowing. Why is the heart broken? Because I wanted A and I didn't get it. The heart's empty. The heart comes empty. We expose ourselves to different things. And when we expose ourselves to those things, that's what then drives the heart to do. To lead the limbs to do whatever the limbs do. So where does a challenge lie? And embedding the passion of Allah's panellat ala. How does a person do that? It's very simple by maintaining hijab. And here I mean the spiritual hijab. And there's a famous principle in science, which also can apply to the heart spiritual heart as well, which is that there's no such thing as a vacuum. There's no such thing as a vacuum. Meaning if you remove something, something else will fill it. Like you put, like my hand pushes the air. There's no vacuum being created. You don't see my hand. Anytime you move your hand, you're pushing air. You don't appreciate it as much. Unless maybe if you move it very fast, you can feel the wind against your fingers. But when you move your hand, you're pushing air, but then something else will immediately fill it. So the principle for the spiritually, for the heart is that if we remove all of the dunya, then the heart will inevitably fill with Allah, with the love of Allah. Why? Because everything around us is an ayah of Allah's panellat ala. Everything around us is an ayah of Allah. Every time the sun rises, it's a reminder of Allah's panellat ala. Every time the sun sets, it's a reminder of the power of Allah. Every time you look at a tree, you look at a bird, you look at the interaction that the each of the forces of nature continuously has in order to produce the perfect environment for us to be able to sustain ourselves and thrive. All of that is a sign of Allah. Every time we sit in a lecture, every time we hear that ayat and the Quran being recited, all of that is a sign of Allah. Every time we make omra, go for Hajj, experience Ramadan, these are all signs of Allah. All, all any one of these things, by the way, any one of them, any one of them, would be sufficient to ignite a passion in the heart that we'd be able to drive a person to be an excellent Muslim. But again, the problem is what? The problem is that we allow competitors to arise within the heart. And when competitors arise within the heart, we express, we allow the hearts to express love for those competitors as if we should have been expressing it for the sake of Allah. I've said this a few weeks ago, and even before that, but just to contextualize this, everybody's doing the thicc of something. What is the thicc of the thicc of the heart? I mean, I know we count the thicc on our fingers, but often we do that because we're supposed to. The thicc of the heart, it's a state of remembrance. Everyone is doing thicc of something. Either we're doing the thicc of Allah, we're doing thicc of ourselves, when you go around the world and everybody's wondering, you know, focusing on what they're going to have for dinner, and then they're worried about what they're going to have for breakfast, and then they're worried about which coffee they're going to have, and then they're worried about which shoes they're going to wear, and then they're worried about what clothes they're going to wear. What are they doing? They're doing the thicc of themselves. They're thinking about themselves, للأخرى ، what coffee do I want what meal do I want what clothing do I want what fashion do I want what house do I want what card do I drive what clothes do I wear this is all meat this is the thick of meat nobody is void of the car in the in the world everybody is doing the question isn't are you is people doing the car the question is what are they doing the car of و if a person does hijab from the world that's around them, people think it's not a big deal like I said before, people think it's not a big deal, I can look at this, I can look at that. But no, everything that we engage or so, every time we engage to dunya, a piece of it comes inside of us. And then it turns us into its servant. And then when we become its servant, we're driven to fulfill all of our desires. And we end up wasting the amazing opportunity that we have, which was to liberate ourselves from being servants of this life, of this world, and to instead place herself in the servitude of Allah's panelist, Allah's peace be upon us all. This is the challenge of the Muslim. To see past the mirage of this world, that's what Islam tells us. None of this that you see is real. This is a mirage, there's a greater reality when this reality is cracked, and when this world is opened, and its reality becomes evident in the grave particularly, then and only then will you appreciate. But what again, what happens is, we let things come into our heart. These things impassion our heart. When they impassion our heart, we give them the love that was due to Allah. And when we give them the love that was due to Allah, we become their servants instead of Allah's servants. Just in order to be able to get something that I desire, I'll get I'll miss a prayer, or I'll come close to missing a prayer, because I'm being driven by that instead of the love of Allah. So where does the whole balance, where does the whole challenge lie? The whole challenge lies in the heart. And the solution is to, so everybody has a heart, there's no negotiating that, and everybody's heart can be impassioned, there's no negotiating that. The only question is what do we ignite our heart with, and the only way to ensure that we allow the heart to be dominated by the love of Allah is to do hijab from everything else. To do hijab from everything else. It doesn't concern us. Look at the prophesy of his kingdom. It didn't concern him. He didn't ask for a particular meal, or have some particular dunya, dunya, you know, goal in the dunya, in the sense of fulfilling his own desires. That wasn't what he would drove him. What drove him was Allah's Qanawat al-Anauq, sure, along the way certain things arose within his life, which were just necessary because they're part of being human. Certain meals need to be taken, marriage needs to occur, etc. Those things were not the focus, they were simply like done at the time and place to the extent that was necessary in order to move forward on the path of Allah. And we choose. Now, I mean, the whole world is madly engulfed in dunya. The whole world is madly engulfed in dunya, and we're no exception. We paint it with a little bit of a stroke of the Islam, and you know, we're sitting here tapping our minds, reminding us that we should have passion in our prayer, that we should have focus in our prayer, that we should spend time with the Qaran, that we should do the Dhikr of Allah. But it's not arising from the heart. But again, the reason it doesn't arise from the heart is because there's so many competitors in the heart that it all becomes diluted. It all becomes diluted. So, this is where the challenge lies. And by the way, the Qaran itself reminds us of this. The Qaran itself is reminding us of this when it says, The Qaran itself is reminding us of this when it says, And from among people are those who take other than Allah as partners. They love them as they should love Allah. Look at the description being given. Amongst people are those who take partners to Allah, they love them as if they should love Allah. So, what's the criteria? The criteria is that they have the love of these partners of Allah. Now, partners of Allah can be specifically translated as idols, but more broadly translated as everything that distracts from Allah. And what's their characteristic? You have good ones in the heart of Allah. They love those things as they should love Allah. And so, what happens? They're driven by that. They're driven by that. But the true believers are even firmer in their love for Allah. Or the true believers are firmer in their love for Allah. They're strong in their love for Allah. So, look at this, even the criteria of love is dividing those who associate partners with Allah versus those who are true believers. This is a simple criteria by which we can judge ourselves in our journey of Islam. What's in my heart? I mentioned this last time, but you literally could take your heart. Just squeeze it. Imagine there was a glass. Like it took an orange and you squeezed it and juice comes out. If we just took our hearts and we had an empty glass and we squeezed it and we saw what came out. You would get a very good picture of who your Lord is. By here, by me and Lord, meaning what's driving you? Who are we serving? If I squeeze my heart and just my desires come out, I want vacation, I want fashion, I want materialism, I want comfort, I want food. If you just squeeze the heart and all that comes out, then that's exactly what we're being driven by and that's exactly who we're servants to. That tells us who we're serving. What is our Ghibla? What are we doing the Laufar around? We're doing the Laufar around three meals a day. Am I doing the Laufar around the love of Allah? The Laufar is a, I understand, the Laufar seven times around the Qaba, but the Laufar is really seven times around the house of Allah recognizing that this is the house of Allah. So this is the question that we should challenge ourselves with, which is what's in my heart? And again, don't think that just because I have a little bit of Islam or a Muslim name or I address like a Muslim or I have a little bit of knowledge or I read some books or I know the Arabic language that I can make the claim that that truly Allah's panamata Allah is the Lord of my heart. That's an academic game. The question is what's driving us. And again, like I said, there's no mixing here. Can't mix water and oil. There's no mixing here. It cannot be, it's not possible that there's all these associates with Allah's panamata Allah in my heart and that I'm going to be driven towards Allah's panamata Allah. Again, it doesn't mean that a person can't live in the dunya. We all live in the dunya. It just means that that can't be the thing that wakes us up in the morning and puts us to bed at night. We can't be constantly scrolling, you know, shoes and shopping and houses and materialism and just we're just constantly thinking about the next level of entertainment. We have heart, we have a responsibility. The responsibility is to lower the gaze for everything within this dunya. Accept the needs and what comes to us naturally in the process of Allah, meaning when I wake up in the morning, I have one goal. I have one goal. How can I take the time that Allah has blessed me with today and get closer to Allah's panamata Allah who is my creator and sustainer? And if there's anything that I'm doing that is going to distance me from Allah, how can I free myself from the shackle of my behavior so that I can rise to further proximity to Allah? Now as we're going through the day, okay, you're working, you're in some money, you have to eat a meal, etc. You have to take care of your family. Those things arise naturally but they're not driving us, what's driving us is a lot. The love of Allah, the desire to be able to achieve proximity to Allah. That's the ultimate challenge. Where does that occur? It occurs in the heart. How does that occur by creating a hijab between everything other than Allah? And by the way, the reason, the reason that so many people experience Ramadan, of course one is Ramadan and the inherent nature of Ramadan. But part of that is the fact that we're so distracted because of the nature of Ramadan, we're so distracted from the things that we constantly feed ourselves on. And by here, feed ourselves, feed ourselves, I mean feed our spiritual hearts, that we finally get the chance to just purify ourselves so that the love of Allah can enter. Because you're waking up early, so you don't have time to fool around, right? You get, you're tired because you're fasting, you get home, you sleep, you get to the muskid, and then you go back to sleep the next day because you're tired from the day, etc. The whole schedule becomes so tight that we just don't have the time to be distracted. You'll find people aren't running around in the shopping malls and Ramadan. People are not thinking about all the things that are normally distracting them in Ramadan. That allows for an experience of, it's not white because we simply purified the heart. By purifying the heart inherently, the love of Allah's panwaratullah will arise within it, which is the tezgia that we talked about last week. Again, it requires, it's not an option here, it requires hijab of the dunya. Every exposure to dunya is a notch down in the opportunity to be able to become impassioned by the love of Allah. Every exposure to dunya that could be sports, it could be business, it could be politics, I mean everybody's got their own cup of tea. So people like to sit around and talk about politics, other people like to talk about sports, other people like to talk about business, other people like to talk, whatever it is, everybody's got their own cup of tea. All this is a distraction in the end. There's a basic minimal amount that's necessary to know, but by the way, those things you'll know anyway because the whole world will be talking about them that you can't avoid them. There's just some things that just, you know, COVID, everybody knows COVID occurred, you don't need to watch the news daily to figure out all the details, you, everyone knows. But it should just be very clear to all of us that if we're serious about bringing, allowing the heart to ignite with the passion of Allah's panwaratullah, then the battle lies at the level of what we bring into the heart. Because everything that the heart is exposed to potentially has the potential to be able to ignite it. And only by protecting the heart and purifying the heart and preserving the heart only for Allah's panwaratullah can a person truly become a lover of Allah's panwaratullah and then through that love be driven to seek the pleasure of Allah and to avoid it. So this is where the whole battle lies, the level of what we let come into the heart. And this is why, by the way, for example, Imam Al-Khazadi, he mentions that, you know, there's layers to fasting. One layer of fasting is you're all aware is that you fast from food, drink, marital relations from early morning to sunset. Everybody knows that. Another layer of fasting is to fast from sin. So food, drink, marital relations, and then a person is very, very careful about fasting from sin. So that's the second layer. But what's the ultimate layer of fasting? The ultimate layer of fasting, food, drink, marital relations, sin, and then to fast from everything other than Allah. When a person fasts from everything other than Allah, the heart very quickly becomes responsive. And the heart easily becomes impassioned with the deen. I should say the heart easily becomes impassioned with Allah, which is then expressed as the deen. So the challenge is that like nobody's saying to you, you have to go find a heart. What was that? What was that Wizard of Oz where they have to find the heart for that tin man? Like nobody's even saying find a heart. The heart's there, it's given. The heart's given. The question isn't find a heart. The question is preserve the heart. Simply do a hijab from everything other than Allah. Don't make my entertainment the focus of my heart. And if a person does that, then to impassioned the heart and to be able to focus and to be able to have energy towards the deen and to be able to express that, to become a true servant of Allah is a simple secondary consequence. It's a natural consequence of a heart that's impassioned with Allah's panawatullah's love and cognizance of him. So that's where the challenge lies. And that's the question we should all ask ourselves. May Allah's panawatullah make us amongst those whose hearts are impassioned with him and may he make us amongst those who express that through excellence in our deen and through the sunda of the Prophet Muhammad's lawaih sent them. And finally SWT would acquire theенно hardships speakers that Gaymah send refuge in God from the Qatimancing relationships of other Allah, the Most Merciful. So that all using words can harmonize that be heard in Mustaipointsatorial messenger forehead punch of the heart with pleasure and letting the centre choose the Lord who lets the best spiritual and the best for the family with the most varied life.
