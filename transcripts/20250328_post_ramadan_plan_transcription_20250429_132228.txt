And it wasn't only that the companions were amazing but rather it was the distance that they traveled which is actually remarkable because all of us are aware. You just have to study the very first few pages of the Syrah to recognize the circumstance in which the prophesized and them was sent. Mankind had reached the darkest stages. In fact, ascending of the prophesized and my rose, when essentially Dean had become obliterated from the planet. And then Allah SWT sent the prophesized and them. He came in the face of the Jaheviya which was of course the era of ignorance. And he took the companions from this extreme of Jaheviya. All the way to the extreme of being the best umma that was ever extracted from mankind. So it's not just that he produced an amazing generation but it's the distance that that generation journeyed which is also remarkable. So based on this to scholars they remind us that we too have to recognize that it's these three functions that lead us to be able to achieve our goals. Meaning that you know you can say one thing you can say to yourself, I want to achieve my goals in Dean, I want to become a better Muslim, I want to become like the companions, I want my heart to be alive etc. But what are the components to that? You know it's one thing to see something that's amazing. It's another thing to know how to make that thing that's amazing. You can go to any restaurant, you can eat an amazing dish and you can say this is good. But then the question is how is that dish made and how can I replicate that? It's panala. We not only have the companions which were amazing and we can read about them. We can see the way they lived their lives. We can read their descriptions in the Quran and be utterly blown away. But furthermore we actually know how the companions became the companions. Which again what's important to us here is that it provides a paradigm for us to be able to achieve our goals. And so the scholars they mentioned that it's important for us to have three domains in our Dean that we specifically address. Number one we should have some recipe for engaging the Quran. This is the first and foremost goal of every Muslim. I'm the one I see within the community that we do a wonderful job at this with our children. And unfortunately we don't apply the same rules to ourselves. I think every one of you who has kids probably has some mechanism by which the kids can engage the Quran. You might drive them to a class, you might have a teacher come visit. You might put them in a Madrasa or a Mechdab so that they can advance their Quran. But unfortunately we don't apply the same rule to ourselves. We don't look for the same outlets where we can't advance our recitation of Quran. And it doesn't matter where we are in the journey. I mean literally we could be trying to learn the letters. Maybe some of us are trying to learn how to pronounce those letters properly. Maybe some of us are trying to learn how to put the letters together in such a way that the rules of the jubi can be applied. Maybe some of us are trying to become more fluent in our recitation. It might be that some of us are trying to memorize portions of the Quran. It might be that some of us are trying to have a deeper engagement with the Quran. But there needs to be there's no it's non-negotiable. There needs to be a consistent engagement with Quran. And I think that's one of the big lessons of this month. Isn't not one of the big lessons of this month. You see the difference when the environment is just overdrive with the Quran. So I would say that every one of us should have a plan to engage the Quran. It doesn't need to be anything extremely intricate. It can be in fact it should be something simple. And I would even argue that it's better for it to be simple because it's much more likely to be completed if the you walk out of here saying that by next Ramadan I'm going to have the Quran memorized. I would have some questions for you. But it's probably not going to happen. It's one of those things where we get excited for a day or two and then we just you know it becomes a distant memory. I think it should be something really tangible. We're something that you can go back and say by the end of the year I can achieve it and by the end of a decade I'm going to be able to value it. So every one of us should have some goal with the Quran. The second domain is the domain of knowledge. I think we do a little better than that. Sometimes we don't even maybe we don't apply it to our children as much as we apply it to ourselves. But okay, Amla Lillah this needs to also be present. And what do we mean by knowledge? By knowledge I don't mean you know the entertainment that you get across YouTube or the entertainment that comes across all these video platforms and things that people are watching. I think here you have to dissect it down into the type of knowledge that's necessary for our theme. Maybe otherwise stated the scholars they say that which is mandatory is mandatory to know. That which is so not is so not to know. That which is super agatory is super agatory to know. What does that mean? It means that there are certain things that we that are mandated upon each of us. For example five prayers in a day. It shouldn't be that we approach the prayers haphazardly but rather we should understand how we can maximize those opportunities because they're going to we're continuously doing them anyway. For example there's a basic fit that's required in every prayer. How do I properly pray the prayer? How am I supposed to recite? Am I reciting it properly? Do I understand what I'm reciting before prayer? Obviously prayer is built upon the hara. Do I know how to properly make will do? Do I know when I'm supposed to make a whistle? How am I supposed to make a whistle? It's not very complicated. It's actually relatively simple. But there are certain things that are mandated upon us and we should know them well. What are the basic legal rulings of fasting? What are the basic legal rulings of Zekha? What are the basic legal rulings of Hajj? And the reason these are so important, one they're mandated. So of course you can only approach Allah through what was mandated upon us. That's the primary mechanism by which we approach Allah. But just as important it's this legal framework that becomes a container in which we can fill our spirituality. We don't get to make up the Dean. Dean has been assigned on us. So we must know how to perform each of the acts properly. That forms the structure in which we can fill the spiritual reality of every single act of worship. So this is the secondary responsibility, our second and not secondary, second responsibility. And each of us should again think about this as we're exiting the month. What's my goal for the next year as far as this basic knowledge is concerned? Where am I going to how am I going to ensure that I'm doing these few basic things properly? Now again, I'm not interested in like the cute nuanced points that we make about certain things. Those are far beyond what we're talking about. Companions didn't even, you know, the companions didn't even dare ask the meaning of alif-lam-meem. You know, we like to know what are the 10 different opinions of alif-lam-meem and what do the scholars say about that? And I'm not saying that's a bad thing. It's a good thing. But I'm just saying the scholars were very sorry, the Sahaba were very straightforward in the way in which they approached the deen. That was they needed to know. They that was they needed to know. They knew. Everything else was built on top of that. So this is another responsibility that falls upon each of us. And the final responsibility, which is that third domain is to ensure that we work on a Tezgia. In fact, I would argue that this is the current that puts all the pieces together. So what is Tezgia? Tezgia is an Arabic word, which basically means to purify, and it has a secondary connotation of growing. So if you want to put all the pieces together, it means to purify such that you can grow. And Tezgia, more specifically, refers to purification of the heart so that it can grow. Purification of the heart so that it can grow. And here, I think that we fail both with our children and ourselves. In the case of Quran, we highly emphasize it on our children. We tend to emphasize it less on ourselves. In the case of knowledge, we don't emphasize it enough with our children, but we emphasize it more on ourselves. But in the case of Tezgia, my personal experience doesn't mean that everybody's in this boat, but it's my personal general experience, that it's something that we don't think about either for neither for our children nor for ourselves. But Tezgia is an essential component of our deen. It's clearly stated that the prophesies on them was doing, was purifying his companions. So what does this mean? Tezgia. So the scholars, they say that Tezgia has layers associated with it. The scholars they mentioned that Tezgia has layers associated with it. The first layer of Tezgia is to purify the heart from Shirk and Qufr. First layer of Tezgia is to purify the heart from Shirk and Qufr. When an individual purifies their heart from Shirk and Qufr, obviously they enter into the fold of Islam. So this is the first layer of Tezgia. And if we're sitting in this gathering, we're probably not challenged with that although we may be in the subtle ways, but as far as globally is concerned, usually we can check that one off. The second layer of Tezgia is to avoid sin. Here we struggle. We allow ourselves to succumb to so many different types of sins, but more unfortunate, those effects over walmus. And when the effects over walmus, they create a massive impurity in the heart, massive impurity in the heart. And then the problem is that the light of Islam cannot coexist with the darkness of sin. So we're reciting the Quran, we're learning knowledge, but that we're pouring it into a vessel, any of the heart, which is loaded with filth and subhanallah. In this advanced age, we come up with advanced mechanisms by which we can impure ourselves. Honestly, in my personal experience, this is where the big battle lies. Usually people are relatively decent about, at least knowing they should engage the Quran. And people often enjoy learning the knowledge of the Dean, but here people fall flat on their faces. We just don't appreciate that every sin ends up impureifying this heart just as the prophesies are mentioned. Every time we perform a sin, there's a black dot that forms on the heart. Eventually, the heart will be layered with black dots until it becomes dark. So this is where we all have to sit down and ask ourselves, how can I achieve purity? Subhanallah, every one of us is unique. In this matter, every one of us is unique. Each of us has our own monkey that hangs on our backs. And what happens is we look at everyone else, we look at ourselves and we recognize that we maybe we don't perform 90, 95% of sin. And then we look at others and we find those that do and make ourselves feel better about the fact that we don't do those things. We fail to look in the mirror and appreciate the 5% that we do fall prey to. Every person has an inherent weakness within them. This is how Allah created us. It's part of the challenge of our existence. It is what renders the battle of Tezqi live for each of us. And as I mentioned a few days ago, Shephan knows our inner selves. And he whispers accordingly in order to try to trap us in that thing which we're weakest with. So here, I think part of growing up and part of becoming spiritually mature is to really understand ourselves. Part of the training, you know that the organization has essentially dedicated to spiritual development and spiritual training. And I can tell you that part of the training, I know when a student has advanced to a certain level when they can identify their own weaknesses. That's part of being spiritually mature. So for example, when a person recognizes that I've got an issue with envy or I've got an issue with anger or I've got an issue with controlling my gaze or I've got an issue with my financial transactions. That's a big step forward. You haven't even solved the problem. You just identified the problem. But that's exactly the point. How can you solve a problem if you can't identify it? If you spend all the time criticizing the rest of the world and saying how the rest of the world doesn't do what they're supposed to do, then how can we look in the mirror and realize who we are? One of the beautiful aspects of this ethic of is hopefully you've had the time to sit down as an individual and to be able to reflect on yourself and to be able to say, well, you know, I'm doing X, Y, and Z. I really shouldn't be doing that. This is discordant with my dean. So I would challenge every one of us in these last few days of Ramallah and for the first time in a long time we can see things clearly. We've been just in a haze for so long. All of a sudden there's a bit of clarity. In these days of clarity, I would challenge all of us to sit down and just maybe list one or two things that we recognized about ourselves that perhaps wasn't so clear before. And then appreciate that these are things that we need to work on ourselves and ask ourselves about how we can avoid in order to be able to rid ourselves particular sins. But I'll just say that look, if you have a ship and it has 100, let's just say there's a ship that has 100 anchors. Let's go back. Sin is an anchor. You're trying to move your ship forward. Sin, your ship can have 100 anchors. You can release 99, but if there's still one, it's going to drag. You have to release 100 anchors to be able to go 100% forward. So sure, maybe we can easily release 95% of things that we know we shouldn't do. Yes, I'm the lily. Don't drink. Yes, I'm the lily. Don't gamble. Yes, I'm the lily. Don't eat pork, etc., etc. But when it comes to the minor sins or the bigger sins that perhaps we don't necessarily attribute to ourselves, those are the ones that tend to anchor us. So I think everyone of us needs to ask this question, how can I achieve my task here? First layer is the Shahada, which I'm the lily, we can check that one off. Second is to avoid sin. And each of us, I think, needs to really ask ourselves the questions where we can help. We're going to be able to rectify that. And then the third layer of Tesquia is to remove all diseases from the heart. What are diseases of the heart? Those are the things that are so subtle that no one can see, but those are the things that can put us straight into the gennem. For example, pride, arrogance, envy, these types of things are very, very difficult to appreciate. Very few people on the planet can recognize that they're proud or arrogant, whether they've got envy or that they're loaded with jealousy. But as we spoke about a few days ago, these are things that need to be removed in order for us to be able to achieve our goals. These are diseases of the heart. Diseases of the heart are extremely subtle. You never can appreciate them in the fog of life. You can only appreciate them in the context of silence and a great degree of spiritual purity. And Subhanallah, that's exactly what's achieved in Attaqav. You've had this opportunity to be away from your regular daily routine for enough number of days that at least you can pick up on the subtle, subtle possibility of maybe I'm arrogant and I behave like a fitter on at home. Maybe I'm loaded with envy and I just look at other people and I'm constantly questioning why they received something that I think I should receive, etc., etc., etc. But this is a layer of Tesquia. In fact, it's so dangerous that as an example, in the case of pride, the prophesies of them said that a person with an ounce of arrogance will not enter into Jannah. A person with an ounce of arrogance in their heart will not enter into Jannah. Because again, Jannah is a place of purity, correct? So without purity, Jannah is a place of purity only accepts those who are pure. You cannot be, you cannot, the heart cannot be loaded with Kufar and Syirq and find a place in Jannah. The heart cannot be loaded with sin and find a place in Jannah. And the heart cannot be loaded with diseases of the heart and find a place in Jannah. Invariably, those things have to be purified. Now, whether they're purified through Allah's mercy or they're purified because there's some time spent in Jannah, etc., they're purified through Allah's forgiveness, the point still remains that Jannah is a place of purity and we're not going to be able to go home until we present a heart that is pure. The fourth layer of fear of Tezgia is to purify the heart of bad, bad character. This is another important layer of Tezgia that the Quran and the Sunnah emphasized upon the companions without it, the companions would not be who they were. What this means is that we have to behave in a certain way because the deen binds us to appreciate that we live in a hierarchy. This is very difficult in today's day and age because today's day and age is destructive to hierarchy. What does hierarchy mean? It means that we have people above us and we have people, we have a place where we stand in society and that we have to act in a certain way depending on who we're acting with, who we're enacting. Who we're engaging? Let's say it that way. Who we're engaging? For example, in this society, everyone is an individual. Hierarchy is not common. It doesn't matter if these are my parents, it doesn't matter if this is my teacher, it doesn't matter if I'm reading Shakespeare, I can have 10 opinions and I can tell Shakespeare what Shakespeare did wrong. That's the nature of how we were trained. This is a deconstructed environment that we exist in. But in the deen, we have definitive hierarchy. We have Allah's panawat ala who is the highest authority. We submit to Allah, we recognize that He is our Lord and we are His servant, automatically establishing a hierarchy. In fact, isn't this the whole point of today's Western society that they're going to rid themselves of this hierarchy? Isn't that what the Renaissance was all about? Renaissance was all about the age of rationalism. Man can decide for man what's best for man. They don't need to be bound by revelation, reason supersese revelation. That kicked off with the Renaissance and is in its full shah today. It's expressed all over the place. That's exactly the issue that we're dealing with. We're living in this deconstructed society where there's no hierarchy. God, what do you mean? God, God doesn't tell me what to do. I tell myself what to do. Isn't that what the world says today? So they've freed themselves from the quote-unquote shackles of revelation and now reason becomes a predominant mechanism by which day make their decisions and decide how they're going to live their lives. Okay, we're not here to criticize others, but at least you should appreciate the context in which you make decisions. You're being trained. You're being fed this stuff every day. You don't appreciate it. When you put your kid in kindergarten, they're being fed this entire, they're being fed a whole way of thinking. We don't see it, but it afflicts all of us. And so edub is so important. It is an essential component. I don't have time to go into all the ayat and the proofs of how important it is, but I will just tell you that the Sahaba recognized this hierarchy. And in fact, this is what binds us. This is how we express our deen. I have a hierarchy. Allah is at the top of that hierarchy. When Allah SWT says something in the Quran, I submit to it. I follow it. I accept it. I understand that he is my Lord and that I am his servant. Some very simple statements that we make. We don't appreciate how challenged we are in them. You know, we recite that every morning and every evening, correct? You are my Lord and I am your servant. But Subhanallah, and that's actually a deep line. We could just sit there and try to reflect on that line. It would be enough because this is actually the problem. We're little gods running around and we think that we make decisions for the world. We can judge people. We can tell people who's right and who's wrong. We can tell people what they should do and what they shouldn't do, etc. So this other becomes important because of this nature because it's an expression of hierarchy. What's the next layer of hierarchy? The prophet's ayat is on them. We submit to the prophet's ayat on them. When the prophet's ayat is on them, we decide something. We accept it. When the prophet's ayat is on them, express something as a model. We submit to it. And here comes the whole issue of the Sunnah. We submit to the Sunnah. It's part of the hierarchy. Now, if I'm caught up in the rational world in which I exist, then I'm going to want to jettison the Sunnah. What Sunnah? What do you mean? That's from 1400 years ago. I don't need to worry about it today. Sure. Yes, there are certain Sunnahs that were representative of life 1400 years ago. There's no question about that. Nobody's writing camels to the muskid today. But there are principles that are embedded in the Sunnah, which are an expression of the hierarchy, which the prophet's ayat is on them understood, and expressed through the way by which he engaged himself. So we have to submit to those. And there's another layer of hierarchy that we're bound to, and that's our parents. Doesn't matter who our parents are. The deen establishes their maqam. They don't have to prove it. People come to me all the time and say, well, yeah, you know, I understand that parents are supposed to be treated a certain way, but don't they have to behave a certain way? No. They actually don't have to behave anyway. Deen establishes the hierarchy already. They inherently received that just by the mere fact that our mothers bore us. You cannot pay your mother back for one contraction. Let alone start wondering why she doesn't treat you the way you want it to be treated. My God, if your mother treated you like a king, then of course you would treat her like a prince, a princess. What's that's not deen? If your mother and father treat you like a prince, then of course you're going to treat them like a king and a queen. Where is deen in that equation? Every person on the street will tell you that if somebody treats you like a king, you should treat them, if you're like a prince, you should treat them like a king. You don't need deen for that. You need deen to tell you that when people don't treat you the way you expect to be treated, you should still behave in a certain way because Allah gives them their mokam. So here's another layer of hierarchy. We're bound by this and it just continues. We're bound by this hierarchy in so many different ways. I'm bound by how I should treat my neighbors because of the fact that they're my neighbors. Of course my neighbors are going to put their garbage in front of my driveway. That's exactly the test. Of course my neighbors are going to like a double park in front of my driveway on occasion. Not by the mustard, I'm talking my way away from them. Of course that's part of the test. So this is the nature of how tests are made. What is Allah's para'atalla really testing when we live life? We want him to test us according to what's most convenient for us. No, he tests us with a little wealth to see how we behave. He tests us with health to see what we do with it. He tests us with youth to see where we invest it. He tests us with challenges. People come into our lives and they speak certain things. Other person walks in the door and says something funny. Another person, you know, parks their car in a funny way. Another person is going to upset me. It's amazing that it just looked for a second and think, dude, ever notice that the people in your life know exactly which button to press on you. It's funny because somebody else will come to you and complain that, oh, you know, this person did this and you'll say, what's the big deal? It's just a small little thing. Let it go. Why? Because it wasn't your button. It was their button. But Subhanallah, an hour later, somebody will come and press your button and you'll freak out. But any other person on the outside will say, what's the big deal? He just did this. Just what, why are you getting so caught up in all this? This is the way Allah Sba'atullah has designed the test. Everybody's test is personalized. Each of our test fits like a glove on our own hands, just like a molecule binds a receptor on a cell with such specificity. Allah Sba'atullah sends tests to you and I that specifically relate to exactly our personalities. That's part of the challenge. That's part of the test of other, that's part of the test of the hierarchy. And we're bound on so many different ways. We have children, they bind us. We have relatives, they bind us. We have neighbors, they bind us. We have teachers, they bind us. It's just the nature by which this world exists and this is the test. To express the proper edub in every one of these circumstances. And the heart has to be impureified of any what we call lack of edub. In fact, the Quran mentions that in a circumstance in which describing the edub of the companions with the prophesy, I send them, that this is the mechanism by which the heart is tested for tukwa. This is the mechanism by which the heart is tested for tukwa. So if we truly want tukwa, which means that the heart has to be pure, correct? So the heart has to be purified of lack of edub, lack of manners in order for us to be able to achieve the purity of heart that we seek. And the final layer, and perhaps the hardest one in this day and age, is to purify ourselves from the dunya. This heart is a design to love and it will only love one thing. You can't mix two things in it. Either it loves the life of this world or it desires and looks forward to the life of the hereafter. If we fill our hearts with the desire of all the goods of this life, and we can dress ourselves up however we want on the outside, but the heart is really just going to be filled with the low world. And this world is just essentially dirt. We can look really, really sophisticated on the outside. We can quote lots of things. We can dress in a very, religious way. We can put ourselves forward in society, but inside, we're just decrepit because we're just really pursuing the dunya. It doesn't mean that we don't exist in the dunya, it doesn't mean that we don't engage the dunya. It doesn't even mean that we have goals in the dunya. We should have all of those, but we can't be sunk. We can't be drowning in our desire for the dunya. Every time I wake up in the morning, I'm just thinking about this life and all of the ways that I'm going to feed myself and all the ways that I'm going to close myself, all the ways that I'm going to house myself. I've said this before. Honestly, it's really worth reflecting on. In my mind, people talk about the kato thikato, the kato thikato, I wish I could do the kato. In my mind, everybody on the planet is doing the kato. The way I look at the world, everybody on the planet is doing the kato. The question isn't whether they're doing the kato. The question is, what are they doing the kato of? Most people wake up in the morning and they're worried about their next meal, which coffee place they're going to go to, what new and unique breakfast place they can find, and they're just doing the kato themselves. This is the kato of themselves. How can I earn more? How much do I have in my account? What's the new way by which I can entertain myself? You know, I've watched 10,000 things on Netflix. What's the new thing that they're going to put out that's going to let me, you know, think that I'm still getting value for my subscription? What's the new TikTok video that I can watch? We're all just doing the kato ourselves. What's the next thing that can entertain me and make me feel good? This is completely disconnected with the the kato of Allah. We should be doing the kato of Allah. What are the things that will please Allah? What are the things that will allow me to earn the next layer in Jannah? What is the thing that I can do that's going to allow me to be able to earn the next state and the next Makam with my Lord? So this is the challenge and this whole battle is the dunya. Honestly, the whole challenge is dunya. Academically, we appreciate everything, but it's the dunya that's the game board of life. This is where we're stuck. And that's why we've been put in this life. We've been put in this life and the body has been wrapped around our soul. Now, what's the problem? The body jails us. The body needs to eat and then we get caught up in giving it all this wonderful food. The body needs to reproduce and we get caught up in how can we help it reproduce? The body needs to be housed, so now we get caught up in which type of house. This is where the problem lies. We have to appreciate this body as a jail. This isn't freeing us, it's jailing us. Every time we fulfill anything more than the needs of the body, all we do is shackle ourselves. We're just shackling ourselves. Every time we think that when we fulfill one meal, that somehow I'll be liberated so that I won't need the next. Who had breakfast and then didn't start thinking about what they're going to have for dinner? That's the nature of human beings. So we cannot be caught up in the dunya. In fact, I would say that the one thing two things. One of the two things that we have to do a job from is the dunya. We should lower our gaze when it comes to things that are related to the dunya. Why? Because otherwise they enter the heart. And once the dunya enters into the heart, the heart is where the whole battle lies. It's the seed of passion. It will drive us to extremes. We literally will get in the car and drive 45 minutes to check out the new coffee shop. Literally, we'll drive 45 minutes away just to taste the new coffee. And then we won't have any example in our life where we drove 45 minutes in order to be able to experience something of the deen. So this is exactly where the battle lies. The heart has to be purified of the love of dunya. If it's going to be filled with the love of Allah. Doesn't when we impose that on the world, not saying that you should impose this on your family members, there are times in which you have to engage the dunya in order to be able to take a break. That's part of the Sunnah as well. But it just can't be the thing that puts us to bed every night. And it can't be the thing that wakes us up every morning. It can't be the thing that dictates how we spend decades of our life. And finally, when we're decrepit and have nothing left, now we want to put ourselves forward for the deen. We have to be real with ourselves. We should spend, we should purify this, we should protect this heart. The beauty of this, we'll talk about this at the very end. Anyway, we should be very careful about the dunya. We should do hijab from the dunya. Because otherwise if the dunya gets in our heart, it will drive us to do things that we'd never imagined and will cause us to invest our resources in things that are utterly worthless. I'm Dallillah. One of the great blessings of the Ethikov and just to close is that Ethikov inherently provides us with a state of purity. Because of the nature of the fact that we're in Rammeldon, we've been fasting, we've been engaging in the Quran, we're in the company of all these wonderful people, this amazing environment. And these 10 days, the inherent nature of Ethikov is that it returns back your heart to the most pristine state, which is the state at which it was born. You're going to walk out of here with a pure heart. That is so hard to achieve. That is so hard to achieve. But the question is going to be, are we going to be able to maintain its purity? So of course, we want to purify it and maintain it from any kufar in shirk. And I think maybe that's the easier one because we understand the severity there. So we keep our guard up. But at the same time, we need to keep it pure from sin. We need to ensure that we've removed the diseases of the heart. We need to think about our behavior with all the people around us and figure out how can we express the greatest degree of etiquette, which I would also argue is the pinnacle of the Sunnah. The pinnacle of the Sunnah is the character of the prophesy. I send them. And how particularly being away from the dunya for these past 10 days, ideally, we were completely disconnected from the world. We really don't remember the things that are going on in the world. We're really not sitting here imploding and planning about how we're going to get the next material good. We should, in this context, ask ourselves how we want to engage the world when we return. Because that's what etiquette from one dimension is. It's a seclusion of yourself from the world so that you can discover who you actually are. And of course, it's going to end soon. It's not where we're way towards the end. We're in the last innings. We're not in the beginning of this game. Quite summary for today is that there are three domains that are essential for our Dine. There's our responsibility for the next 11 months to make a plan for each of these domains. If we do so, we'll be able to advance ourselves in our Dine and it would argue that in the context of this discussion, we should specifically emphasize our Tezgia and think about the different layers by which we can purify the heart and make some small intentions about how we're going to be able to try to maintain this degree of purity that Allah SWT has blessed us with in the beauty of these 10 days. May Allah SWT make us amongst those who are able to engage the Quran consistently. May He make us amongst those who are able to gain knowledge of Dine that is purifying, that is pleasing to him. And may He make us amongst those who are able to purify our hearts so that we can present those hearts to him on that day when we will be judged.
