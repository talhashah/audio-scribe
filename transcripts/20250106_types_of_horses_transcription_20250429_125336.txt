مستفي Young with an Individual, ارغّ as my intention to keep a horse و that they keep it carefully for the sake of a lot. و challenges that mean that a horse is only going to be used活 ell things that are for the sake of a lot.Kevin example either battle or the dessert and the Prophet of fast is said that this type of a horse is a reward. يا حيا تت need. ليست من الأح� discovery ، You know the yearning and the feces of the horse ، the dove of the horse يعمل لثنانا solid عندما نع skeletons من هذا مодعوا صديقات είو الله Freielu airlا Brydٌ عholesاجة م mesela MATA وكيف يتبع في المنطلقات المعطلة which would be considered in pure become a reward for the person because it was for the sake of a lot just because of the power of intention that you can literally take something that's in pure and make it a reward for a person so this is the first type of horse the second type of horse is the horse that's sitar sitar is like a shield but the implication here is that that which is necessary for use for example, I have work so it's a tool for my trade maybe I'm a trader, I have to move stuff around whatever it might be, I'm a farmer, I need to use a horse for a certain purpose so this is the second type of horse and for this person it's essentially like something good but it's essentially neutral it's not that kind of reward that was described initially now of course anything that we do for the sake of a lost panel that's all so long as we maintain its rights that becomes beneficial for us so there's benefit there but it's not that beneficial that every single blade of a grass that the horse is consuming becomes just a reward for a person on the day of judgment but anyway it's a second type of horse meaning it's something that is for everyday use something that's necessary for the individual and then the prophet Ithanam mentioned a third type of horse it's upon the person Wizard is like a burden like a headache it becomes a headache on the person how does it become a headache on the person because the person essentially has it for the purpose of showing others what they have now at the time of the prophet I said them and even till today honestly in the domain of horses some people will purchase horses merely for showing that they have a horse like a very thoroughbred horse thoroughbred is like a race horse so imagine that at that time particularly when horses was where the major means of transportation and the way by which you would exhibit wealth a person buys like a thoroughbred horse not because they want to use it for the sake of Allah there's no intent there not because they actually need the horse for a purpose there's no intent there but rather they purchase it just to show others that they own this horse they want to show others this the uniqueness of their horse the ability of their horse or the fact that they are the owner of the horse so the prophet I said them highlights that this type of horse becomes Wizard Wizard is like a burden burden you want to think like a headache a sin this thing becomes a headache for the person now you might think the guy who's got the flashy horse let's call it flashy horse 1400 years ago the guy who's got the flashy horse how was that a burden for this guy right it's not a burden everybody's like well man you got that horse and he's showing off as he rides that horse and everybody's turning their attention to the person so they see him whizzing by in that horse with that horse but it becomes a burden because the person is doing it out of arrogance to attract people's attention essentially it becomes a competitor with Allah and in this sense that all attention is only due to Allah the only purpose of our existence is to draw attention to his magnificence not ourselves so because this person is showing off to the world in his world at that time it ends up becoming a headache for the person maybe not in this life because they're going to get lots of accolades for owning that horse but rather it becomes a definite headache in the air after it's a definite headache in the air after because they will be asked about that horse and of course it will be exposed the reality behind that horse Now again like I said earlier we don't own horses today for the most part some people do but for the most part we in our context we don't own horses today but the Hadith and the circumstance in which the prophesy some of them is discussing this topic is still as relevant today as it was at that time because perhaps we don't own horses but we own so many other things and essentially what's being highlighted is a paradigm of wealth when Allah's Allah blesses us with things or the opportunity to be able to convert our wealth into things there's three types of intentions that we have meaning there's three buckets one bucket is to allocate some thing for the sake of Allah and Allah alone and in that context even the impurity of it becomes a source of reward Another allocation is to allocate our wealth to the things that we need for the purposes of whatever we're engaged in for example I need a car so I need a car so I drive my car to work I drive my car back okay there's a reward in that in the sense that I'm going to a halal job I'm earning a halal income for my family my intent is the sake of Allah I'm grateful to Allah for having provided it but it's not that allocation that every you know every mark of a tire becomes like a reward and the third allocation is one that we should shine and run from and that allocation is when wealth the purpose of the wealth is to show others in our extravagance and that's the thing that we should run from as far as possible because that thing is going to be a big headache for people on the day of judgment it becomes a burden the word in Arabic here is a burden a burden meaning like a type of sin almost it becomes a heavy weight on the person so any time a couple things to think about here number one we definitely want to allocate our wealth to category A some piece of wealth of ours should be allocated to category A because it becomes an endless opportunity so we should ask this question do I have any thing that I've invested in that becomes like an adjot for me adjot in the context of this narration right? that type of thing where every dimension of it becomes a multiplier for reward for me all right, let's use an example because maybe a very common example if we want to just contextualize this as horse to car all right, I think everybody in the room has got a car and they use the car to do relatively good things for example they get in the car they go to work hamd alillah they get in the car they even go to the mosque hamd alillah they get in the car and they go and buy the groceries hamd alillah so that's like a sitar it's like a need we have a need, we fulfill that need, we think we thank Allah for it it earns us some degree of reward, it's beneficial and it's to the extent of our need but maybe we should ask the question have we ever purchased a vehicle for the sake of Allah you might think why would I purchase a vehicle and what kind of vehicle is there for the sake of Allah I don't know, maybe the muskid needs a car in order to be able to you know pick up and drop off something or you know you can come up with some example I don't know, example carpet okay, carpets in the muskid carpets at home right, carpet can be like on the wall to show the world it's like a type of carpet that you have and the carpet in the muskid even the threads that come up as the person vacuums it becomes a continuous source of reward for the person right, even the every dimension of the carpet becomes a source of reward for the person and the carpet that a person has at home it's there, they need it, it provides some degree of comfort it has a use, we take advantage of it and the carpet on the wall that you know you put up so that the whole world can you can show it and say I bought this you know ancient 3000 year old carpet in Mesopotamia it does it's a steer to show people it doesn't necessarily provide a benefit it's certainly not a reward but cars are the same way you know cars on other extreme maybe you can't think of an example of a car for the muskid but there are certain times where cars are beneficial you buy a car for example for it you buy the ambulance for the local hospital that's a good example let's do that you buy the local hospital needs an ambulance or some hospital in the third world the developing world needs an ambulance so you purchase the ambulance everything regarding that car including the flat tire the air in the tire becomes like a type of reward right so maybe we should ask the question have I invested in that way right every every every material good has three categories associated and what we don't want what we don't want is that hot flashy car you know that turns everybody's attention towards us and the purpose of our buying it is is that we can attract people's attention because that becomes a competitor it becomes a headache now competitor to what nothing competes with Allah in reality but it becomes a competitor in the eyes of people in the sense that people's eyes get turned towards it and that wasn't the goal of our existence our goal was never to turn people's eyes towards us our goal is to turn people's eyes towards Allah meaning towards the reality of Allah so now we should think about our wealth in that way in every category in which we spend in every category in which we spend we should ask ourselves when I do A, B and C is this Ajr? is this sit up? is this wizard? in fact these are three good words to memorize right these are the three types of categories categories of how we behave with wealth and this is a challenge for everyone of us when we're thinking about how we allocate our resources we should ask these three questions for example I have a printer at home right I have a printer I use it for my daily stuff I print out my bills I print out my this I print out my that maybe I should buy a printer for the mustard at the same time I buy a printer for myself every drop of ink on that printer which is being used for the mustard is going to be a source of reward for me it's that type of thinking right that look what's being highlighted here by the Prophet's eye said that it's essentially two things many things but two things to take away one never underestimate that which is completely allocated to Allah that's one point that you can take away never underestimate that which is being completely allocated to Allah meaning that you would never in your right mind fathom that the dung in the urine of a horse could be a source of reward for a person yet the intention for the sake of Allah and a complete allocation to Allah's panawat Allah results in that so that's very powerful so that's one one many among the many things that we take away that's one thing and then the opposite extreme also needs to be recognized which is that we should avoid that category of the things that are going to become a headache for us on the day of judgement because again we see past the what's the benefit of attracting the the praise and you know the foolish accolades of the people of the world what good was it they're just as passing as we are and there's no lasting nature to their accolades and nobody remembers I can guarantee you the guy with a fast horse 13, 1400 years ago nobody remembers their name they're buried in the same graves that the rest of us go into and these details got lost in the book of history but of course it's recorded by Allah but nobody remembers them whereas can you imagine the people who invested 1400 years ago in the sake of deen and we stand on their shoulders today literally everything that we do is predicated upon their sacrifice can you just imagine what power their multiplier is going to be the reward that they're going to gain and who knows maybe today we do something and 500 years from now our generations will stand on it something really simple you know some some sacrifice that we make meaning the big picture here is that Allah's panellatala is absolutely cognizant of the things that we do solely for his sake alone solely for his sake alone no combination of even work just solely for his sake alone and Allah's panellatala appreciate it recognize it and rewards it in a way that we will never be able to comprehend such that every angle of it becomes a source of blessing for the person so we should be we should seek every such opportunity we should seek every such opportunity where something can be halas you know completely absolutely purely only for the sake of Allah and we should put a little bit of our allocate a little bit of our resources I'm not saying everything has to go for that but we should allocate something we should be able to look at every year every year people go through their taxes every year people go through their receipts we should be able to look at ourselves annually when we're reflecting on our expenditures our wealth etc. and say yes okay I bought this for me I bought this for the house I bought this for the family but this was purely for the sake of Allah this was purely my contribution for this and I and I I I portioned this I allocated this purely for the sake of Allah and that will earn us a very very large reward and this is again the general way by which we should think of wealth we want to invest in those things that are going to produce immeasurable reward we want to purchase the things that are necessary we're providing ourselves and this life the deen encourages us towards—and in fact, there's a reward in that as well it's just not that degree that we mentioned with the very first example and we want to avoid the plague anything that's done to draw attention to us ma'alahs pan fajal Awj on makَّ the كثم so thanks to those who were able to apportion our wealth to for his pleasure alone and may that protect us from ever pursuing those things which draw away from his attention or واخر جاءونا أن
