 حمد لله وكفا والسلام على إباده الذي نصطف أما بعد فعوض بالله من الشيظان الرجيم مسم الله الرحمن الرحيم والذين جاهدوا فينا لنا هندي انهم سبولنا سبحان ربك رب للزد عما يصفون والسلام على المرسنين والحمد لله رب العالمين الله مصلي على سيدنا محمد وعلى ألي سيدنا محمد وبارك وسلام سبحان الله كمكس وعلى وعلى وعلى وعلى وعلى وعلى وعلى وعلى وعلى وعلى وعلى وعلى وعلى وعلى وعلى وعلى وعلى وعلى وعلى وعلى وعلى وعلى وعلى وعلى وعلى وعلى وعلى وعلى وعلى وعلى وعلى وعلى وعلى وعلى وعلى وعلى وعلى وعلى وعلى وعلى وعلى وعلى وعلى وعلى وعلى وعلى وعلى وعلى وعلى وعلى وعلى وعلى وعلى وعلى وعلى وعلى وعلى وعلى وعلى وعلى وعلى وعلى وعلى وعلى وعلى وعلى وعلى وعلى وعلى وعلى وعلى وع because each of them uniquely varies and is different than the other. small philosophical so let me give you some examples of what I'm trying to say. so there's a person his name is Zaid and Zaid is living in the world but Zaid has so many different things that are pulling at him from different directions Zaid amina give it any name give the person any name sister or brother they're all the same they all have challenges that's the way that Allah has created this world as a test. so زيث has or amina has responsibilities to their parent. they have responsibilities to their children. they have responsibilities to their neighbor. they have responsibilities to their creator. they have responsibilities to their workplace. whatever circle they're engaged in, there are constantly, it's a constant tug of war. things are pulling at you in different directions and you're trying to determine what to do at any given time and place. and you'll see that Barnes & Noble's and the bookstores of the world are loaded with advice. but really, what is this advice except advising or often, most often advising people as to how they're supposed to handle one aspect of their life or another. the beauty of the Dean is that the Dean creates for us a paradigm by which we can know how we're supposed to engage all of the people that are in our lives. for example, if you have a question about how you're supposed to behave with the neighbor, the Dean gives you details very, very, very, very nuanced details about how to deal with the neighbor. if you're confused about how to deal with parents, the Dean makes it exceedingly clear how we're supposed to deal with parents. if you're confused about how and what responsibilities you have to a spouse or if you have to your children or you have to your teachers, etc. all of this is elucidated by the Dean. and so Hanolah, this is one of the reasons why the Dean brings peace in the heart of a believer. now, Islam is for those of you who know a little bit of Arabic, you know, that that's verb form 4, that's the name of Islam, Islam and Islam, essentially verb form 4 is like a causative form to cause something. Salama means peace, right? and Islam is causing peace. and one of the dimensions of the peace that Islam brings is that it brings peace to the one who embeds it within their lives. why? because when a person embeds it in their life, all of the chaos and confusion, like how do I behave? I've got this tugging at me, I've got that tugging at me, I've got this responsibility before me, I've got that responsibility before me, all of that becomes resolved. look, I'll give you a very simple example. Allah's Panawatullah benefits a sub, or blesses a subset of the population with wealth. and then Allah's Panawatullah challenges another subset of the population with lack of wealth. now, when you compare somebody who's wealthy and somebody who's not wealthy, it's not, I know we like to attribute it to ourselves. I worked hard, I went to a good college, I'm really, really smart, and I'm street smart, and I know how to talk to people, and I'm very slick in the way in which I do my transactions. that's why I'm wealthy, and this person is not. perhaps there's a little bit of room there, but this comes from Allah. Allah's Panawatullah is the one that blessed us with ability, gave us the minds to do what we're able to do, gave us the intellect and the opportunities that are present before us, and Allah's Panawatullah has created a dichotomy. there's a subset of people that are given wealth, and there's another subset of people that are challenged with a lack of wealth. both are a test, by the way, none of it is a reward. if a person who has wealth presumes that this wealth is there because it's some reward for the things that they've done, then they're highly mistaken. wealth is not a reward, wealth is a test. and if a person thinks that they don't have wealth because they're being punished for some reason, then that's also highly mistaken. wealth is not a reward or a punishment, it's a test. there's a dimension to it that can be a reward or punishment, but it predominance is a test. now, just imagine for a second if a person's wealthy. now they have to ask themselves a question. I'm being pulled in two different directions. I have a responsibility to spend on my family, I've got some things that I want to do with my wealth. I may even have some desires that I want to fulfill, but at the same time I've got this challenge of these other people who don't have wealth, look how stressful that would be on any person of sincerity. and you see that within society today. society is being ripped apart at its seams because they cannot figure out how to handle this dichotomy between the 1% and the rest. and they have no solution. the wealthy are hiding their money in all these different places. and we're not going to go there, but my point is that you can see that for anybody of sincerity, there would be an utter confusion as to how am I supposed to balance this. what allows me to know that I've fulfilled the rights of the society around me, while at the same time making sure that I also get an opportunity to partake of the wealth that I've been blessed with. and Spanelot, Islam creates the perfect paradigm, but which that's resolved. Islam says, look, your wealth is yours. I'm the la la bless you with it. you have the right to spend it on yourself. you can't be wasteful, but you have the right to spend it on yourself. you have the right to spend it on your family. but 2.5% of the excess wealth has to be given to those in need annually. now, that's a great blessing for everyone. why is that a great blessing for everyone? because the wealthy can relax. they don't have to feel guilty that I have reserved the rights of the poor. and the poor can also relax because they know that they are going to receive something that Allah's panwaratullah has already mandated for them, so they won't be this like desire for more. so, this is just one example of how Islam essentially creates the circumstance which allows everyone to be at peace with the other. in fact, you know, the scholars they say that Zaka as you're aware, Zaka is a term in the Arabic language which carries two connotations. number one, a connotation of purification and number two, a connotation of growth. and so the scholars they say that Zaka essentially is a mechanism of purification that leads to growth. so they give three examples, classically. they give lots of examples, I'm just boiling it down, and simulating it into three. number one, when a person gives Zaka, they purify their wealth, allowing it to grow. and we all know that when we give Zaka, we scrape off the impurities, the prophesies on them said that Zaka is the impurity of people's wealth. when a person removes Zaka, the impurity is scraped away, what's remained is blessed, and what remained will then grow. so notice this purification which leads to growth. number two, the heart. every one of us has a heart that's designed to love. and it is going to see the world around it and it's going to desire it and it's going to fall in love with it. and the more you talk about it and the more you engage with it, it's naturally going to come in the heart. but how does a person purify themselves from being deceived by the world that's present around them? because it's just passing and it has no lasting nature to it and it has no permanent, it has no permanence nor does it have any ultimate reality. but Zaka is one solution to that. because when a person gives, it purifies the heart of greed, allowing it to grow and love for others and it's going to be a real hope in the hereafter. so that's another example of purification which leads to growth. and the third example, which is what I was touching on earlier but just again circling back to the point that I was making at the beginning, was that they say that Zaka purifies a society allowing it to grow. how does it purify a society allowing it to grow? because when the rich recognize their responsibility that comes with their wealth and they spend it on the poor consistently annually, then this creates harmony within, it grows harmony within society purifying this class dichotomy that creates stress which historically has led to revolutions if you just read the books of history. you don't have to go further than any AP history class to read how dichotomies and wealth have led to crazy revolutions throughout the history of mankind. and so how does that purify Zaka, when a person gives Zaka, they purify all of these feelings that are present within the class warfare that exists between rich and poor, purifying the society allowing it to grow and balance, harmony, love, respect, etc. so this is just one example, the point I was trying to make, the broader point that I was trying to make was that Islam, the beauty of Islam, is that Islam creates a balance by which we can understand the world around us and our responsibilities within that world that exists around us. I don't have to be confused about the rights of my mother, I don't have to be confused about the rights of my wealth for others. I don't have to be confused about how do I deal with my neighbor, with my children, with the people around me. my schedule, all so much of my life is already the paradigm of Islam just structures my life in the perfect way, I've got these five prayers, I have to pray these five prayers in between I've got some free time, I need to leverage that free time, I can design my day around it, I don't think any of us appreciate what scaffolding the dean provides, because unless we've been distant for the dean from some time. and you go out in the world, it's crazy, when you don't have any scaffolding, people just become, they degenerate, they degenerate, they need something upon which we're human beings, we all need something upon which we can scaffold our lives, and this is a great blessing of Islam. Now, this whole notion of this balance, essentially like I said at the beginning, it's like a transaction, life is like a transaction, and there's a ledger, and this ledger is being recorded, and it's this ledger that actually will be weighed on the day of judgment. Now, all of you know, we recite every time in the prayer, maliki omid din, maliki omid din, master of the day of judgment, this word adin, normally you translate din as religion, correct? I ask you, anybody, if I ask any, what does dean mean? They'll say religion, dean is religion, my dean is Islam, but dean also actually has an underlying meaning to it, which is what? Which is debt, a relationship with this concept of debt, for example, many of you know, in Arabic, the word dain refers to debt, which is also derived from the same base as dean. Essentially, the way you want to think about this is that we exist in a world that creates debts around us. For example, I'm indebted to my parents, I'm indebted to the greater society in which I exist, I'm indebted to my spouse, I'm indebted to my children, I'm indebted to the masjid, below that, I'm indebted to Allah, that's actually the first one, right? I'm indebted to Allah, I'm indebted to the messenger of Allah, so I send them, I'm indebted to the community, which allows me to thrive because I'm not unique and independent, I'm dependent upon everything around me. So because I, by nature, I'm a dependent being, I'm completely indebt from so many different directions. And dean is the mechanism by which I discharge that debt. And the day of judgment, Mali Ki-O Mideen, the master of the day of judgment, the day of judgment is the day in which my discharging of those debts will be judged. That's essentially what the day of judgment is, right? So I have a debt to Allah, Allah created me, created everything around me, created every opportunity that I have, created every ability within me. There is no place I can turn except that I have been, that I am dependent, right? This is what it means to be dependent. I am dependent on Allah, so I'm indebted. And how do I resolve that debt? So pan Allah, honestly, if somebody said to me, hey, I'm writing a book on how I resolve my debt to my Lord, it would be being such the four, 24-7. Honestly, that wouldn't be, that wouldn't suffice. If we have to sit here and academically determine what's the mechanism by which we can resolve the debt that we have to Allah, everybody could come up with an idea, but the ideas would be extreme. Like, hey, never leave the mustard. You should just be in such a 24-7 a side sleep and food, right? That would still not suffice. The debt we have to Allah's pan Allah's talent. But, SpanAllah, the dean teaches us, but look, you need to do A, B, and C, and it's really, honestly, it's minuscule compared to the fact that we exist. It's minuscule, five prayers a day. Okay, this is your debt to Allah. Five prayers a day, which honestly benefit you and, obviously Allah's pan Allah is not in need of those prayers. They benefit Allah's pan Allah is not in need of those prayers. Five prayers a day. That discharge is that debt, fasting in the month of Ramadan. That discharge is that debt, paying Zakaq from our wealth, that discharge is that debt, going for Huj, once in a lifetime. That discharge is our debt. The very, very initial step, acknowledging that Allah is one, that He has no partner, and turning to Him and Him alone, is the very beginning of how you discharge that debt. This is it. That's all that's required of us. That's the essence of how you discharge that debt. And on that debt will be judged on the day of Dean, Mandiqiyyumiddin, Yomiddin. And on Yomiddin will be asked a question, how did you discharge this debt? That's the nature of being dependent. Now, I have other debts and otherwise those debts create opportunities. I'm dependent on the fact that the Prophet's ayat-sa-nam sacrificed and guided me. Now, you may say, what do you mean, guided me? But the point is none of us would be where we are today, without the Sunnah and all of the efforts of the Prophet's ayat-sa-nam upon the Sahaba, upon whose shoulders we stand today. So, we have a debt there. And how do we resolve that debt? That debt is so simply resolved by loving Him, by appreciating and acknowledging Him. Okay, it starts very simply. It starts by the Shahada, right? Which essentially, the Shahada is the mechanism to clear two debts. How do you clear your debt with Allah, and how do you clear your debt with the messenger of Allah? So, the Shahada acknowledges those two debts. Then, the responsibility that falls upon us is to love the Prophet's ayat-sa-nam, to follow his Sunnah. And when we hear his name, to at least have the decency to say, Sallallahu Alaihi Wasallam, these are some few things that the Dean establishes as a mechanism by which we discharge that debt. Okay, because I'm dependent. I'm dependent on Allah. How do I discharge that? I'm dependent on the messenger of Allah. How do I discharge that? I'm dependent on my parents. I would not be present if my parents did not make all the sacrifices necessary for me to become who I am today. But how do I discharge that? The Dean tells us. You have to honor them, respect them, serve them. Do not argue with them. I was speaking with a brother a couple of days ago, and he was complaint. He was talking about how he's having this difficult relationship with his parents, and I said, but wait a minute. What do you mean you argued with your parents? You can never win. There's no ever winning an argument with your parents, because the moment you say something you lost, it doesn't matter what the topic was, except the oneness of Allah and the Prophet's ayat-sa-nam. Aside from that, there is no argument that can exist with a parent that you can ever win, because the moment you say something you lost, it's over. That's the nature of parents. And the Dean teaches us that. That's the status not given by me. It's not given by some book and Barnes and Noble. It's given by Allah's panellat ala and his messenger. So I send them. So this is the way by which we discharge our dependencies. I'm dependent on my family. Without my family, I would not have structure in my life. I would be alone. I wouldn't have a spouse. I wouldn't have children. I wouldn't have a home. There's no home without a family. You can have a house, but you can't have a home without family. So I have responsibilities to them. I've spoken about those responsibilities on many occasions. They are our focus. They are a primary focus. We will be asked about them. We will not be asked about the friends that we hang out with on Saturday nights. We're not responsible for the friends that we hang out on Saturday night. A bunch of sisters can go out together or a bunch of brothers can go out together. None of them are going to be asked about each other. But we will be asked about our spouses. And we will be asked about our children. And perhaps we'll be asked about the immediate family that surrounds them. So this is another layer of dependency in the Dean teaches us how much emphasis that the Dean plays on maintaining family relations. And the professor says that the best of you are the best of families. I mean, panel, that's a big statement. But it brings balance into our lives. It brings balance into our lives. So again, this is another layer by which I resolved debt. Now look, I exist in a society. I'm a dependent on that society. I'm not going to work without somebody having paved the roads around me. I'm not eating food except that there were thousands of people involved. If not hundreds of thousands of people involved in producing that plate that exists before me from both the plate to the meal, etc. We exist in a society we don't exist independent. The moment we think that we're independent, that is a very, very dangerous thought. Now, because we exist in a society and because we're dependent upon that society, we carry responsibility within that society. Which means what? I can't just be focused on myself and not worry about what's going on in the world around me. Meaning, I can't be eating food, but my neighbor is hungry. I can't be healthy, but my neighbor is sick. I can't be clothed, but my neighbor is lacking basic necessities. Islam puts that debt on my shoulders. That I have to have enough care to ask the question, is my neighbor eating? And that's a responsibility that falls upon all of us. Now, that's part of this debt. And that's the nature by which we exist in the world around us. It's constant transactions. Each of us has responsibilities and those are perfectly aligned. Now, I, out of my own desire to entertain myself, can alter those layers, but the dean makes them very clear. I've got a responsibility to Allah. I've got a responsibility to the messenger of Allah. So, I send them. I've got a responsibility to my family. I've got a responsibility to my neighbor. I've got a responsibility to the community in which I exist. And then perhaps maybe the broader society around them. These are all layers of responsibility and dependency. Dependency first. They're layers of dependency, which yield responsibilities. And the dean teaches us how we transact with others in order to fulfill each of their rights and the balance in the most balanced way. And Subhanallah, that's the beauty of the dean. It captures the most essential interactions that occur in our lives and provides us with a rubric by which we can succeed in each of those interactions. And what will be the day of judgment? Except a ledger of what's happening with those transactions. That's the day of judgment. It's just a ledger. It's just a ledger to say, okay here, where are your responsibilities, tomu'ansea, where did you stand? Here, where are your responsibilities to the messenger of Allah?空著ة them. Where do you stand? Where, where are your responsibilities to your family? Where did you stand? Here, where are the responsibilities to the neighbor? Where did you stand? Here, where are the responsibilities to others? Where did you stand? That's the day of judgment. Well, we'll be the first question on the day of judgment. First question on the day of judgment, will be salah. سلا will be the first question because like we mentioned once you take the Shahada the primary responsibility becomes سلا right once you so Shahada is just an acknowledgement of this debt essentially when a person takes Shahada they humbled themselves lower themselves recognize them as dependent not independent for all of them thought he was independent correct we recommend we recognize ourselves as dependent we take the Shahada to acknowledge that dependency and then we we carried the burden of responsibility that's yielded by that dependency so that's the Shahada the next thing is so a lot first question will be asked on the day of jazr will be so a lot if that's good shall i everything else will have a reason from that and will also be good and if that's lacking then real problems will begin so we should appreciate the dean as this beautiful system that places everything in harmony for us and because we have that system it brings tremendous peace to us because we don't have to be confused by the chaos that surrounds us and it brings peace and harmony to the society around us because honestly if everybody would have simply just do their job everyone would be fine it's like if you play any sport right everybody has a position and the coach will always say just play your position i don't need you to play like the three other positions good i just need you to play your position if everybody on the team just simply plays their position then everything else will be fine that's how dean is like honestly if all of us would just simply take care of ourselves our responsibilities to Allah and would just take care of our families i don't even need anyone to do anything more we don't the dean doesn't need anything to do anything more anything more than that if honestly imagine if everybody took care of their families what the what the strength of the community would be relative to where we are today and that's that's that's the necessity like i've mentioned before look you come to a musjid you talk to like a small tiny fraction of the community i don't have access to your third cousin who knows maybe your third cousin maybe going to another musjid maybe they won't be but i mean there's a small percentage of people that show up on the musjid and the rest of the community is not here so but you do you have access to them and actually you're responsible for them i may not be asked about your third cousin you might be so that responsibility is carried by every single person around us and it's exactly how the prophet says how they began when the prophet says and then was in my cut that's where he started he's like fretting over every single relative like concerned about every single relative starts from one circle and it expands and it expands and it expands anyway the summary of the talk is that this dean is a mechanism by which we appreciate dependencies and understand how we can engage the world through transactions and it creates for us this beautiful paradigm a beautiful mechanism by which we can ensure that we fulfill the rights and responsibilities of each of these dependencies beginning with Allah and then the messenger of Allah so i said them and then ourselves and our families and then our extended families and then our neighbors and communities and finally the greater world around us and of each of us we're just to simply play our position if each of us were to simply just play our position you would see exponential advancement of the community rather than worrying about what everybody else is doing and what everybody else should be doing and white and playing three other positions that we shouldn't be in we just played our own position we would see exponential advancement in the community may Allah's panel wa tala make us amongst those who are able to appreciate our dependencies may he make us amongst those who are able to fulfill and recognize and fulfill each of those responsibilities that are placed upon our shoulders and may may he make us amongst those who are able to answer for those dependencies on the day in which those dependencies will be judged wa lahir al-Tawana and in hamdulillahir on bil al-Alamin
