 حمد لله وكفا والسلام والعلاق باذه الذي نصفا أما بعد فاوذ بالله من الشيطان الرجيم بسم الله الرحمن الرحيم الذي يوسوي سوفيسوضون الناس سبحان ربك رب للزة عما يصفون والسلام والعلى المرسنين والحند لله رب العالمين الله مسلع على سيجدنا محمد وعلى ألي سيجدنا محمد وبارك وسلم الله مسلع على سيجدنا محمد وعلى ألي سيجدنا محمد وبارك وسلم الله مسلع على سيجدنا محمد وعلى ألي سيجدنا محمد وبارك وسلم سراء الناس which is the last سراء of the Qur'an has many interesting features related to it and last night I began to introduce some of those this afternoon we're going to speak about one additional feature so again just to highlight maybe the theme first so that we can contextualize what I'm going to say سراء الناس the theme of this surah is that it is a mechanism by which we seek protection with Allah's panawat ala from one of the most or one of the most grave evils that is present before us there's many evils that exist in the world around us but the source of all evils shape on the source is of evils shape on and in surah and nass we are given a prescription by which we can seek protection from shape on most specifically it's important to recognize that although shape on has many weapons and we'll discuss this at a later time Shat'an has many weapons the major weapon by which Shat'an functions is to whisper in the hearts of people in the chests of people and in the hearts of people Shat'an cannot take my hand and force me to do something Shat'an cannot pick me up and put me in a place Shat'an cannot cause me to behave in a certain way he can only insinuate and whisper and based on those whisperings I can then choose to do X, Y, and Z so the mechanism by which Shat'an achieves his goals it's important to know this the key mechanism, it's not the only mechanism but the key mechanism by which Shat'an achieves his goals is to whisper in our hearts now Subhanallah the scholars say something very interesting here if you look at surah and nass you can see the construction is very, very clean and simple it's a protection with Allah's panawat-e-Ala who is the Lord of mankind who is the King of mankind and who is the God of mankind against the evil of the one who whispers and retreats which is Shat'an so this is the construct essentially the construct is very simple we are seeking protection from Allah who is the ultimate source and the place to where we should take the truth the place to where we should seek refuge against the greatest evil which is Shat'an and we are given some specifics about Shat'an we're giving specifics about Shat'an we're told, for example, he whispers in the hearts of mankind where Shayyat-e-Ala in general whisper in the hearts of mankind and that he's honnass means the one that comes and the one that goes the one that comes and the one that goes never gives up but continuously shows up and retreats so we'll talk again more and more detail about that as well but understand the construct here which is to seek protection with Allah against the ultimate threat which is Shat'an now, Subhanallah, not only are we seeking but we're getting some information at the same time that we're using this prescription because like I said Allah's panawat-e-Ala tells us about his attributes, he's the Lord, he's the King, he is the the Lord, the King, the Ila, the God and at the same time we're given some attributes of the enemy, some features of the enemy for example, he's honnass which means he comes and goes like I said he whispers and he where does he whisper he whispers in the chest of mankind so Subhanallah, we're given details on this side too but one point that we're going to make right now there's many, many points of discussion that are all very interesting but again one point that we're going to make right now is that noticed we're ship on attacks a levy you was we Sufi, Sulu, in Nass he goes straight for the juggler because he whispers right into the heart and many times we've said this and it's a general principle of our deen the battle is here in the heart now Sulu, in the Arabic actually means chest but the scholars mentioned that there's a discussion amongst the scholars is it the heart plus the entire chest or is it the heart? the point is the same which is that this chest slash heart is the central area by which which drives human beings the heart is what drives human beings if this heart is pure and good it will drive us to do that which is pure and good and if this heart is corrupted and evil it will drive the limbs to do the most corrupt and evil things that even we can't imagine everything is in the heart and ship on knows us and goes straight for the drug juggler he's not wasting any time not like playing around whispers straight into the heart and for us this is a lesson of course one of the lessons is that we're learning the mechanisms of ship on but for us this is a lesson of the importance of the heart as well meaning that the battle for our salvation both good and evil is going to arise within the heart and I think we can all appreciate this many times we've given this example but it's something that you can just understand look the heart is the source of passion and it is passion that drives human beings you can take human beings and manipulate them and tell them to do something and maybe you'll get them to do it for a little bit but they're never going to do it well and they're never going to do it in a special way unless it's coming from their heart they're driven by it just a simple example which I've given many times before but it's always worth thinking about is that who's the best sixth grade math teacher who's the best sixth grade math teacher the best sixth grade math teacher the best sixth grade math teacher isn't the one that can force all the students to learn the material maybe again temporarily a teacher can force the students to do this regimen and get them to get an A in the class and you would say wow this was a good teacher but that's not the best sixth grade math teacher the best sixth grade math teacher is the one who impassions the person to love math because if they love math they're going to be doing math when they're 60 and that's the sign of a great teacher and that's the sign of a great teacher the great teacher inspires the heart to be able to produce that creates a love for the for the topic or a subject which then causes the student to become a consistent mathematician not just a student of math and Subhanallah the greatest teacher in the history of all mankind was the prophet Al-Aysenim and this was exactly what he embedded in his companions he worked on their hearts and when he worked on their hearts he created within them the love of Allah Subhanallah and once they have the love of Allah everything else is secondary everything else is secondary if he says do this they will do it because what he says is not just a statement that he's making but rather it's a statement of what pleases Allah and what potentially displeases Allah and when the Sahaba learned when the Sahaba's hearts were rectified the entire Quran could be revealed upon them and when they were told to do ex they would do it and when they were told to leave why they would leave it I mean a great example of this is the example that we've shared many times before and that is when alcohol was finally prohibited Subhanallah the Quran prohibits alcohol stepwise the Quran prohibits alcohol stepwise because alcohol is a difficult thing to leave when it's embedded within a society and particularly in the society of the jahiliya it was not an easy thing for people to be able to leave alcohol at that time so the Quran prohibits its stepwise but Subhanallah once the Quran is now the Quran is doing its stepwise because of how embedded it is within society and all of us can see from around us that if you try to stop people from drinking who are alcoholics it's very difficult or who are regularly consuming alcohol it's very difficult even in this society today people have to go to alcoholics and Allah said they go to meetings for years and years and years when they're trying to give up alcohol alright so you've got this stepwise prohibition of alcohol until finally alcohol is just cut off and it's prohibited and once it's prohibited it's interesting in Bukhari there's a description of what happened on the day that it was it was a finally prohibited when it was finally prohibited there were literally in some of the companions were literally consuming it literally sitting and distributing it for consumption but when the command was made they heard the command and they dropped the alcohol in the street outside of their homes and the companion says that when I went to take the alcohol that was in that gathering and drop it inside the outside in the street I saw that alcohol was flowing in the liais of Medina what does it mean? it means that not only one individual responded that way they all responded that way why? because there were lovers of Allah and sure it might have been a challenge at that moment it might have been a challenge to leave alcohol but to attain the love of Allah was the only goal and if that meant having to drop alcohol in the street and never touch it again it was achievable for them because they saw a greater goal which was the love of Allah so essentially their deem was an expression from the inside out they were lovers of Allah and whatever was needed to express that love was going to be achieved if it was to do a bother they would be up in the night doing a bother because every moment was ecstasy to achieve a closer proximity to their Lord and if per chance per chance they happened to cross a boundary that would have led to the displeasure of Allah or the displeasure of the messenger of the Surah-Sahis on them the moment they saw that on his face he didn't need to say a word the moment they saw that on his face they would retreat and they would rectify themselves they would seek a lust forgiveness and start a new without him saying a word if they just saw some displeasure that the Prophet saw that on him is not smiling at me that the way he normally smiles he's not looking at me that the way he normally looks at me they just appreciated the tiniest of displeasure they recognized that that actually was a reflection of the displeasure of their Lord they would retreat and they would sometimes even ask what have I done but they would reestablish themselves knowing that the only goal was the pleasure of Allah because the only opportunity of our existence is Allah everything else is just as passing as we are you can achieve anything in this world it is just merely as passing as we are I could earn a palace it's going to pass just like I passed I could literally control all the wealth in the world it's going to pass just like I passed because the whole world is passing we're trapped in this bubble of time and space and this time and space is just a passing, passing place there's nothing that we can grab except that we're grabbing grains of sand or we're trying to grab water from an ocean there's nothing that we can take the only real opportunity is for us to break the shackles of time and space to break the shackles of creation to attach ourselves to the creator of all of creation that Allah will al-Amin the Lord of the universe when we connect with the Lord of the universe that's what grants us status that's what grants us reality that's what results in our elevating ourselves outside of this limited creation and connecting with something that will result in permanent reward in the hereafter that's the challenge we all face honestly if we saw Jannar Jahnnam we would never care about any of this stuff that's present in this world this world is just a distraction the problem is we've been trapped in this body and this body has desires that are naturally inherently associated with it now I got to deal with the fact that I want some food I've got to deal with the fact that I like recreation I've got to deal with the fact that I have a little bit of enough and I have to worry about what people think about me and these are all jails I've been jailed in these things they're not functions of the soul they're functions of the body the soul doesn't care about the food of this world doesn't care about whether the person thinks I'm nice or not the soul doesn't think about any of those things the soul doesn't think about any of those things those are all bodily functions so our challenge is to appreciate that the greatest opportunity in fact not even the greatest that's actually a immunitation of the reality the only opportunity to just be very very frank and clear the only opportunity is to see past everything of this life and to then connect with Allah to appreciate that this life is only a mechanism to achieve that real goal that if I have wealth it is only to be spent in order to achieve the pleasure of Allah that if I have abilities they should be used to seek the pleasure of Allah and even to the extreme which was the attitude of the Sahaba if my life is going to be given for anything it should be given only for the pleasure of Allah they wanted to give everything because they saw everything as passing even their lives they would say if they would be on the deathbed dying it would be almost like a disgrace for them I had my life to give but instead it ended up on the deathbed dying so this was the reality of the companions but the reality was predicated upon what it was predicated upon the heart in the same way in the same way just as the provaltois send them is working on the hearts of his companions and through them our hearts in the same way Shiflon is not playing games Shiflon too recognizes that the battle lies in the heart so he goes straight for the jugular and that's the worst enemy doesn't waste time wrestling with us in playing games with us straight for the jugular which is the heart Al-Levi, you were so fee-so-dood in nest he just goes straight and whispers into the chest and the hearts of mankind and so we have to appreciate that and from this we gain two benefits benefit number one we're reminded of the heart that the heart is where the battle lies in fact as I've said before which is just the quotation of the provaltois send them a takwa ha-una takwa takwa the consciousness of Allah God consciousness the fear of Allah is where ha-una how Huna means here and the provaltois I'm appointed to the chest to the heart in particular takwa ha-una takwa is located here this is where the battle lies you want to know who's got conscious just because your parents told you to do a-b-r-c or you grew up doing a-b-r-c or somebody told you that you need to do x-y-n-z in order to be a Muslim that isn't the chief takwa those are expressions of takwa the battle actually lies in the heart it has to come from the inside and be expressed on the out what is the inside the inside's the heart what's the expression all of the mandates of our deen are expressed through this love of Allah and at the same time shethan is also working on our hearts so we have to protect and preserve ourselves shethan and appreciate that he whispers in the heart and is through the whisperings in the heart that he achieves his goal because once he's whispered into our hearts that you should love this or you should want that or you should desire this or what about this or what about that it's all downhill there's no hope after that whatever the heart wants the heart will eventually achieve whatever the heart wants so we have to be we have to appreciate the power of the heart and we have to be amongst those that guard the heart and in this context we have to appreciate that Allah's panawwata Allah is in his prescription for protection against shethan one of the great benefits of that prescription is that he not only tells us that we need protection against shethan he tells us the mechanism by which shethan wages his war now that's important because when you know the strategy of the other team that's how you know then how you're going to do play defense for example if i come across the i don't know all the plays of the team in the super bowl if i come across all the plays of the opposing team it's over the opposing team can never win if you watch the super bowl they're always hiding in any sport they're always hiding what they're saying and they're hiding their plays because if the other team knows the plays it's over right here Allah's panawwata Allah actually reveals the plays of shethan he reveals to us the plays of shethan which is that one of his plays there's a few more we'll talk about them over the next you know sessions but one of the plays of shethan is that he whispers in the hearts of mankind so we have to defend ourselves which means the battle lies at the heart we have to protect the heart from all evil anytime anything evil comes in the heart we need to we must expunge it immediately we must fill it with as much goodness as possible because this is what's generating everything that's expressed outside of it so we always want to protect against every evil we don't want the evil of the ears to come into the heart we don't want the evil of the eyes to be to let into the heart because these are the pathways to the heart the eyes, the ears, the minds, the tongue etc all of these are evils that can potentially afflict the heart may Allah's panawwata Allah has to seek refuge against with him against the evils of shethan and may he grant us the wisdom to be able to protect and preserve our hearts
