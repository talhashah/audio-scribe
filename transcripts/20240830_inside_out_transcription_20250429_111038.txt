 الحمد لله وكفى والسلام على إباده الذين استفع أما بعد فعوذ بالله من الشيطان الرجيم بسم الله الرحمن الرحيم والذين جاهدوا فينا لنا حديناهم سبولنا سبحان ربك رب للزتي عما يصفون والسلام على المرسلين والحمد لله رب الاالمين quizzنا الله السيدنا般 وأعداء بعодыaremos محمد وبركысلنا visto Θ bachelor Mobism محمد وارد Fightingяз队 baitOur Muhammed واعداء كiencieshelm بنEMA صحيح لقدت صدقائم إذا كان البنةони привامه ان استعريف لهذا إذا كانت تатиعبها إن إesselنا بصاحيةパ pinky أبíem مالف Hell between Islam and IslamOn the level of the law and the School of theeszbone of Islam يتمنى أن their heart should be impassioned with the love of Allah. هذا هو the summary of the whole deen. هذا هو the summation of the whole deen that the heart should become absolutely enthralled with Allah's panawat ala. و what happens when the heart is completely absorbed in Allah's panawat ala that manifests in changing the behavior of the person. و when the heart is desiring Allah, then it will drive the person to do everything in their power to connect with Allah. because if of course if the heart loves Allah, it's going to want to get as close to Allah's panawat ala as possible. و it will do everything available to it to attain that proximity. و the opposite is also true. the heart that's in love with Allah's panawat ala that desires Allah's panawat ala that appreciates that the only opportunity in our existence is to connect with Allah's panawat ala و it will never want to be distant from Allah. it will never accept distance from Allah. which basically means that any single thing that can distance it, that can take it away from the proximity of Allah's panawat ala, it will avoid. and essentially this is the summation of the actions of the deen. because what are the actions of the deen? either they're halal or they're haram. those deeds that lead to proximity to Allah or those deeds that lead to distance from Allah. and that definition of seeing the world that way requires that you start with the foundational premise which is what? which is that I want to do everything in my power to attain every degree of proximity to Allah's panawat ala and I want to do everything in my power to avoid anything that will take me one level away from Allah's proximity. I want to avoid every single deed like that. that's called Islam. that's the inside out version of Islam. inside out version, I don't mean there's a version of Islam, that's the inside out expression of Islam. it's being driven by the heart. nobody needs to sit over our heads and tell us you need to pray five times a day. did you make wudu? why are you doing that? you shouldn't behave this way. you shouldn't be involved with those people. when these types of comments are made, these are coming from the outside in. when somebody tells me you need to make wudu, you need to pray five times a day. you shouldn't do this deed, you shouldn't hang out with these people. this is the outside world trying to tell me from the outside how I should behave on the inside. but how long does that last? you think that if there's a kid and you tell that kid, you have to study, you have to study, you have to study. maybe they'll study for a year, two years, three years, five years. but the moment they get out of the control of the parents, they're never going to study again. because it didn't come from them. it came from the outside telling them what to do. and even if they tell themselves externally to do it, they're never going to be a true academic. they're always going to just be playing the game, playing the role. like I know I should study, just for as an example, using studies, I know I should study, but I just can't get myself to do it. and I eventually get lazy and I burn out because it's not coming from the inside. it's not a passion. so, Islam is an expression of something from the inside. the whole secret of Islam doesn't lie in the mind. of course, the mind plays a role. it doesn't lie in what the world tells us. it doesn't even lie what I lie in what I tell myself I should be. it lies in igniting this heart with the passion of Allah. once that comes, everything else is downhill. and by the way, isn't this the expression of the deen of the Sahaba? anytime they would learn of any deed that would allow them to attain even the slightest degree of proximity to Allah, they would race towards it. race towards it. why? because it was one more chance to gain just a bit of proximity to Allah. and anytime they would do anything, if they potentially did anything, that could create the potentially lead to the displeasure of Allah or his messenger, they would back away like that. they would just see the response of the face of the prophet, just from looking at the response of the face of the prophet, if there was even the slightest degree of potential displeasure, they would back away from that deed as fast as possible. make toba and move forward. so, that was the deen that they expressed. and that was because their hearts were impatient with Allah, with the desire of the proximity of Allah. it wasn't because they were telling themselves they needed to do a, b, or c, it was some sort of like academic discourse in their mind. I need to do this, I need to do this, I need to do this. I understand that's the way we live life today, but that's not the deen of the companions. and this is the criteria that all of us should hold ourselves to. all of us should hold ourselves to this criteria, which is that I should be driven by the love of Allah. it should be what wakes me up in the morning. it should be what causes me to go to prayer. it should be what makes me perform wldu and appreciate the opportunity and the benefits of wldu. it should drive me to take advantage of every single opportunity that pops up in front of me throughout my day. so that I become the express Islam in the most excellent way. so yes, it's important to understand these are the do's and these aren't the don'ts and these are the rules and this is what I need to avoid. all of that's necessary, all of that needs to be laid out. but there's another layer underneath that. you have to scratch the surface and say all that has to arise from what? that all has to arise from the heart. that is here. that's an academic thing that I write down on a piece of paper. I shouldn't do this, I shouldn't do that. this is my takwa. takwa arises in the heart. in fact, there's the narration of the Prophet, that is the takwa hauna. and the Prophet, and it was pointing to the chest. takwa is here and it rises in the chest. so this is the first thing that all of us need to appreciate, which is that Islam is an inside out expression. that is outside out meaning that it arises from the passion of the desire of Allah. and every single thing around us is just reminding us of that. the rising of the sun, the setting of the sun, the full moon, the trees, the movements, the perfect symphony of every single molecule in the universe. this is all reminding us of one thing, that Allah in the lot. there's nothing else. the world is a distraction. the world, you have to understand, the essence of us is inside. we're placed in these bodies, we're trapped in these bodies, we're stuck with the need to eat, the need to house ourselves, the need to close ourselves, the desires that are present within us. these are a cage. the reality is that this is just a cage. we've been caged in this body. now I get hungry, so I got to figure out how to eat. now I have a need to, you know, I have certain desires within me that are necessary needs that I need to fulfill. that's because I'm trapped in this cage. the goal isn't to like further lock myself in the cage. the more I pursue food, the more I cage myself. nobody ever says that, you know, I had one excellent meal and it was done. who says, I had the best dinner, I don't need dinner for the rest of my life. no, the guy who has one excellent dinner, now looking online and wondering which one has more Michelin stars. oh, there's a Zabihah place that has a Michelin star. let me fly. we're gonna book the next ticket. this is all a cage. the essence of the dean arises when we decage ourselves, when we free ourselves. either we're servants of our desires or we're servants of a lot. if we're servants of our desires and we're doing, it wakes us up in the morning and puts us to bed at night. we pass out fulfilling our desires. I'm so tired because I watch so much Netflix that can't keep my eyes open. what's driving that? that's just the person has turned into a slave of their desires. but there's a reality. we have to cut past that. we have to see the inside out nature of this dean, which is that we have to impassion the heart with a love of a lot. this is the first principle that every person's excellence has to recognize. and by the way, this is the mechanism of excellence in anything. like I just said, just big, you know, if you want to produce a child that's brilliant. getting an A in the class doesn't tell you that the child's brilliant. it just means that they did everything that the teacher told them to do. fine, I understand that that's subset of people can go on and succeed in life. you can get through life that way. but what produces brilliance? when you impassion the child with a love to read or write or compute. that child, even if they're not a straight A student, that child will actually go on to do amazing things. because they now are being driven by the love in their heart. these are the people who stay up all night and win Nobel prizes. you know, you don't win a Nobel prize because your parents told you you have to. you win a Nobel prize because you fall in love with knowledge and science and advancing the human cause. and that then drives the person towards excellence. it's again, like what I'm trying to highlight here is that this is the case in all pursuits. it comes from the heart and the same is true of them. it comes from the heart. so that's principle one. that wasn't the topic coming. I'm just laying the foundation. here's the topic. how do you impassion the heart? how do you impassion the heart? you impassion the heart in a few different ways. one way is to be exposed to something that can ignite it. and I'll tell you, Subhanallah, we have the ultimate. we have the ultimate feature in our Dean that can ignite any heart. and that's the Quran. the Quran's power, of course, it's a miraculous book. and from every single dimension when you dig into it, you just find how mesmerizing it is. and from the Quran's power, it's a miraculous book. and from every single dimension when you dig into it, you just find how mesmerizing it is. but the essence of the Quran is that it impassions the heart. it ignites the heart. and it drives the person towards the pleasure of Allah to avoid the displeasure of Allah to seek the reward of Allah and to understand the, see the world for what it really is. which is just one big deception. one cage. that's the power of the Quran. it's the message of the Quran. you can get caught up in the technicality and everybody wants to learn, you know, tell me this point and tell me that point and every time you have to entertain people with the next interesting point, there's benefit in that. but the essence of the Quran, the Sahabah's experience of the Quran was essentially a book that would impassion their hearts. it's, I find it very interesting. sorry, I'm just going off the rails here because I'm prepared. but I find it very interesting that the companions, they don't even, they don't even, didn't even necessarily know for, well, we don't know if we knew, if they knew for certain what was the meaning of alif-nahmim. like the first thing you interact with in the Quran, you know, alif-nahmim, that he can the Qatab. and yet the scholars cannot even with the Quran, and yet the scholars cannot even with absolute confidence tell us what those three letters mean. like there's no like narration in which the Sahabah said, Ya Rasulullah, what does alif-nahmim actually mean? and he's giving them like some discourse on it. because it was sufficient for them to appreciate that this is just the word of a lot and this is doing its job which is that it's striking the heart and it's impassioning me to change my behavior, to change my focus, to change who I am, to make me a true servant of a lot. that was how they saw the Quran, and every single verse would impassion their heart in that way. in fact, every single letter would impassion their heart in that way. every letter of the Quran, alif was one letter, alif-nahm was one heart, alif-nahmim was one heart, each of that would just impassion their hearts. and then you see what they expressed. the the the the deen was an expression of something. just like you know, in biology, like a jeen gets expressed, and then it produces the protein, the protein is secondary to the jeen itself. the protein is secondary to the jeen itself. you need the jeen to be able to express the protein. this was their this was in their DNA, the Quran was in their DNA, in their heart, in the DNA of their soul, which is what's called the heart. so, so, panola, we have access to that today. it's not some fairy tale that we're talking about that people lived, you know, 500 years ago, people lived 1400 years ago, they were like this and that. no, we have the exact same preserved book of Allah's panola that was impassioning the hearts of the companions. may Allah be pleased with them. what else impassions the heart? the thicket of Allah impassions the heart. we have just as much access to that today. what else impassions the heart? the signs of Allah. we're not reading some story 1400 years ago, the sun rose. all of us should be amazed. 1400 years ago, the sun set. all of us should listen to the story of it. 1400 years ago, the moon became full. all of us should listen to the story of it. 1400 years ago, the grass grew and the animals graced. and we should listen to the story of it. no, it's vividly present before us at every single moment. there's not a moment in which you can turn in any direction, except that you appreciate the magnificence of Allah. all of that is a mechanism to impassion the heart towards the greater reality. that's the purpose of creation. isn't this what the Quran calls us to? look at the sun, look at the earth, look at the moon, look at the skies, look at the mountains. all of this is calling, calling us to what? it's not calling us to the mountains. it's calling us to the creator of the mountains. it's calling us to the ayah and the Allah. this should impassion the heart. every single narration from the prophet's law it's calling us to the ayah and the Allah this should impassion the heart. every single narration from the prophet's law is a spark that can impassion the heart. in Subhana Allah, our scholars have preserved these narrations such that we can hear the words of the prophet's law even though we can't hear them from our ears. but they're available for our souls. every gathering of the pious every gathering of the pious is another opportunity to impassion the heart. there's just a myriad of opportunities out there الطiscover تحتاكل من تعب機يا شاء ط Pardon Laddenة قد تعب من الخора وej than all of the things dinosaurs to compassion the heart are able to trust حي Hä؟ أين كأن البيتين ؟ يبد gegangen to what do we do كذلك نبت uses watch andritt to just came to my head at moment حي مبتعين يبدو which we do بعض الكlavير عامشة like people مثل مي who want to start a barbecue you know what they do they like take the lighter fluid they just spray it all over the cold they don't think ten times what they're doing and they throw a match in they get this big fire they got all excited and then like five minutes later they're looking down and nothing is burning wait that's like big fire was created all this excitement everybody from far is looking wow what's this guys are serious expert they produce such a big fire and two minutes later everything disappears you can't even find the ashes it was such a superficial you know show this is the same thing with us we like get into a gathering we get a little excited and we go home and we just become the same people that we were we come into like these amazing opportunities all the pie as people get together all this time, energy, spend and we just return back to ourselves get exposed to the ground every single verse of which is just a igniter of the heart and like we get all excited when we're together and then all of a sudden it just all dissipates and we become the same people that we were it's just this lighter fluid you know superficial comfort that we have or we've turned our dean into this as well now why doesn't the heart impact why doesn't the heart ignite why doesn't the heart ignite because we didn't prepare it properly you know if you stack up the colds properly and let them soak a little bit prepare everything properly you know in the right way and you create a pyramid and you soak the colds and you let them be ready for you know a few maybe you know several minutes let everything soak in properly you can put them at you you'll produce such a beautiful fire that not only will it cook your food it'll warm everybody around you little cold here or a little cold there people will even come and light their own fires from that that's the type of fire that we have to produce in our hearts but what does it require? it requires preparation it means that the heart has to first be ready to be to be ignited you can't just show up in a gathering and expect that everything's just going to change that's just lighter fluid on top of cold it just burns for two minutes and dissipates you have to prepare I'll give you another example that you know unfortunately we all relate to more maybe you think about the NFL season the NBA season, the MLB season PGA whatever you want to pick your flavor you think that they just show up on day one and play no they actually prepare from months in advance you don't just show up on day one and like you know you're playing the first game of the season these athletes they prepare year round they're preparing year round I think they take one two weeks off some of them like for example the season ends they spend maybe one or two weeks just resetting and then from the couple days after the season ends they're already entering the next season the beginning of the season the midseason that's the end of their season meaning that's the expression of all the training that they had before so this means that the the onus is placed on our shoulders we want our hearts, everyone has a heart everybody in this room has a heart Allah is not Allah bless us with a heart if we want to impassion these hearts we have to do the groundwork beforehand we can't expect we're just going to put ourselves in a gathering and somehow the gathering is just going to take care of everything I agree it will produce a flame for a minute or two but it's not going to light the colds that responsibility falls on our shoulders now most of the population and where we live doesn't even care about this topic so let's eliminate them the few people that do care they don't want to prepare they just want to show up they want to show up they want the scholar to give them the lecture and tell them everything and make them feel good and then they'll leave but they didn't prepare the responsibility for preparation falls in you and I we want to go in the company of our scholars we want to go in the company of our teachers we want to go in a positive environment people spend five, six, seven, eight years in Amadrasa and come back and tell me I'm not feeling spiritual so what are you talking about? you're not feeling spiritual the heart wasn't the heart must not have been prepared because what greater environment can you find than such that environment for example the problem is in the heart, the battle lies in the heart and to prepare the heart this is the whole discussion of there's one word that describes the preparation of the heart it's called desquia desquia everybody in this room knows what it means we've talked about it so many times but this is essentially the challenge desquia of the heart the heart has to be purified inherently the heart is designed to burn to burn with passion that's how the heart is designed and every person on the planet is driven by their heart people who entertain themselves incessantly and seek party to party you know, seek entertainment to entertainment what drives them? there's nobody telling them they have to do that that's in their heart they're impassioned by that they'll stay up late at night and they'll go from club to club or place to place or venue to venue in order to entertain themselves they're being driven by their heart everybody has a heart and every person on the planet is being driven by the heart so we have a responsibility to prepare this heart to prepare this heart so that it becomes ignited and that's basically desquia and desquia is just very very simply a complete and the ultimate purification of the heart so that it could easily become impassioned by the deep when we say that you know the heart must be pure of sin this is one layer of desquia when we say that the heart must be purified of bad etiquette this is one layer of desquia when we say that the heart must be purified of this arrogance and envy and greed you know that is constantly consuming so much so many of us that's another layer of desquia and in particularly when we say the heart needs to be purified of dunya as a whole dunya as a whole that's another layer of desquia and each of these is a challenge and the dunya one is particularly a challenge because like I said what we end up doing is this dunya is a cage it precludes the heart from reaching its full potential anytime we anytime we pursue our desires anytime we make an effort to satiate our desires all we're really doing is caging us with the next desire like I just said just because a person eats a wonderful meal they're never going to say to you that was such a good meal I'm done I'm done for life they're only going to say how can I have that again people will say it's funny somebody takes a good I don't know what's a dessert cheesecake somebody takes a good cheesecake someplace it's interesting every time they go to dinner someplace different they'll order cheesecake and before they even put the fork in the plate they'll say I wonder if this cheesecake tastes like that one cheesecake I had it's like they're pursuing the next cheesecake and even though they can have 10 cheesecake that will just be average they'll eat half and throw it away because it's not good they'll say I'm still trying to find I'm in search of the next level of cheesecake that's how people live that's what's driving their heart and we have to appreciate that until we finish and we have to appreciate that until we free ourselves from the shackle of our desires this heart will never ever ever get ignited it's just a fantasy it's just like a story we tell each other like hey I'm going to put myself in the mustard I'm going to do this I'm going to join this gathering I'm going to join this circle of learning I'm going to sit in the company of the chef I'm not saying these things aren't beneficial humdolillah they preserve our deen I'm just speaking to those who are seeking the passion of this deen the passion of this deen is never going to these two things are discordant meaning it's water and oil it can't be that like we're pursuing the dunya our heart is full of dunya and this heart's going to ignite it won't ignite because it's already burning with something else it's already burning with dunya now we mask it we call it halal and certified this these nace names but in the end it's just a pursuit of our desires it's just a pursuit of our desires and these two things are discordant and you go through the Sunnah the Prophet said them and you're never going to find the pursuit of desires in the Sunnah of the Prophet said them you're going to find the opposite you're going to find the pursuit of Allah and the pleasure of Allah and the shunning of trying to fulfill every single desire that pops up in our minds somebody once, one of our teachers once said to me you want to know the status of your heart and you want to know what the result will be on the day of judgment you don't need to know anything you don't need to play any, you can run one simple simulation one simple simulation just imagine for yourself just imagine for a second that you had an empty glass and you took your heart and you squeezed it into that empty glass what's going to come out whatever's in that cup that's your spiritual state if like when you squeeze that heart it's full of like where do I live what do I drive what do I wear where is the next meal going to come when can I have when can I be entertained with the next meal if that's basically what the heart is full of and that's what's driving the human being that's what the glass contains and that's going to be the consequence of the person and if you take the heart and squeeze it and it's full of the glass fills with the love of Allah the love of his messenger the love of the ahrah a desire to have a perpetual reward which can't even be computed against the foolishness of this world that's a completely different human being but how many human beings are there on the planet that are like that everybody's caught up in dunya they painted in a different color but everybody's caught up in dunya everybody's caught up in behaving the way they want to behave everybody's caught up in their own arrogance everybody's caught up in their own greed everybody's thinking about me and myself and I only think what we do is about ourselves how can we be entertained how can we be fed where's my next vacation how can I get my next degree where's the service in all where's the service in all it's just a service of the self it's not the service of the humanity which is what brings people closer to Allah's panawat these are the hard questions we have to ask ourselves because this is the opportunity that sits before us you know you used to go to the beginning of the college year and this is the beginning of the college year so you go to the beginning of the college year and they inspire you they tell you like what's one of the things they tell you they tell you tell all your friends and relatives that you're not going to be available for the next few months and that they all need to make a little bit of an adjustment why? because you're here like you're going to be 100% focused here we need you to completely present yourselves and we need you to take advantage of the opportunity they inspire you so that they can create a passion and you have to create a passion and you then you're going to be join the circle of scholarship that's present at that institution for example anyway the summary for today is that this dean arises from the heart arises from the heart that's the whole of Islam the heart the battle of the heart and once the heart becomes impassioned with the love of Allah and it is desire to attain and understanding of the reality of the world around us then this heart will express the sharia even more than that it will express every opportunity to please and approach and gain Allah's proximity and reward and it will shun every opportunity of sin it will shun every opportunity of sin but we have that responsibility of maintaining this heart of protecting and preserving this heart so that this heart can be ignited by the Sunnah, the Hadith, the scholars, good company, etc how many signs it's like constant signs all the signs are myriad of signs that are present around us but this battle lies in the heart and the heart is in the heart and the heart is in the heart but this battle lies in the heart and we have to be absolutely defensive you know like they say that just as an example just give one example to close the Dean places a very very high premium on hijab the Dean places a very high premium on hijab and by hijab I don't mean just some scarf but what I mean is creating a certain barrier between the things that are potentially that can potentially arise in the heart that would cause you to do something that would violate the tenets of the Dean notice that those rules of hijab they apply to everyone they apply to everyone we don't say like oh you must do hijab because you made this mistake no the rules of hijab this necessary separation apply to everyone why because everyone has a heart and even the softest minimal expression even the softest minimal interaction can cause a person to interact with another and start thinking about them constantly which then drives the person to go to a place to speak in a way that they shouldn't have spoken to do a thing they shouldn't have done and eventually to end up in a place that they shouldn't have been and everybody is required to maintain hijab from the time that they attain the age of puberty all the way until the time of their death because no one is immune why because everyone has a heart and a tiny tiny seed can impassion the heart and completely take a person down the wrong path so this is the nature of human beings they have hearts and the heart requires it to be protected so that it doesn't get impassioned towards something that it shouldn't be impassioned towards the same is the true of the same is the true of the dunya we have a responsibility to maintain hijab from the dunya we don't want to dress up the dunya we want to maintain hijab from the dunya now of course we all have to interact in the dunya we have to engage in the dunya we all have professions, we have to be excellent in our professions we all need to be educated this is the strength of the community this is the armor of today's knowledge all of those are responsibilities of all upon our shoulders and we have to fulfill those but what I'm talking about here is this like incessant mechanism to fulfill our desires this is the dunya and we have a responsibility to do hijab from the dunya not to advertise the dunya not to relabel the dunya in some way that makes us feel comforted and like we're just chasing our pleasures constantly we have to do hijab from the dunya like you know when you have to go into a circumstance where you you know that maybe your principal of hijab might be at risk you tread very carefully you'd be a little extra careful because you know that I'm in this environment there's a potential risk of hijab here okay I need to be a little slow in the interaction I need to be a little careful I need to be a little methodical about how I engage in this circumstance because it's just a tad less than what I'm comfortable with that's how we have to behave with the dunya like I got to eat but let me just do it to the extent necessary and be careful about just impassioning my heart with the desire of our constant food okay I have to you know close myself but let me do it in a balanced careful way and be careful to not make this like the thing that drives me okay I need certain material goods in this world because those material goods are necessary for me to be able to get from A to Z and for me to be able to comfort my family let me do it in a way that this doesn't take over my life that's the issue it's not the issue the issue is that it shouldn't be the it shouldn't become the purpose of our existence otherwise once the heart is impassioned with that then it's over no by the way these layers of deskia you know these different subtypes these different issues related to deskia each one has its own and importance you know good character removing removing bad manners and bringing in edib it's essential removing diseases of the heart and bringing in humility et cetera it's essential but I would just argue that in the material world that we exist in today we're just like this incessant like how do you want it sir you know how do you want this ma'am it's like this constant service everything is instant and everything is exactly the way you ordered it I would argue that this issue of the dunya is the biggest thing that plagues us today because the world has become so material like you literally go into the grocery store you get confused which orange you should I buy because there's like 16 different orange juices on the shelf literally there's like 16 orange juices on the shelf so much material so much emphasis on the taste and the desires of each person like do you desire low pulp do you desire medium pulp do you desire high pulp do you desire low acid do you desire high acid do you desire calcium enriched or do you desire no calcium do you desire freshly squeezed do you desire you're your orange from Florida do you desire your orange from another place literally like it's like you get confused if you just stand in front of just the orange you section and I have anyone gotten to the thing next to it you go to the yogurt then there's 50 50 choices not even 16 it's complete materialism it's like complete materialism it's like complete materialism complete pursuit of just this is all dunya can you imagine the solvah sitting in front of like orange juice and sitting at 16 different orange juices it's like ridiculous like even just any kind of like comfort and luxury it was like a question in their mind like is it in my if I take this cold drink am I exchanging my gen my acrid off her here am I taking a little bit of my reward here such that it'll be reduced there I don't even want to take that risk I don't even want to participate to that extent again I'm not trying to push everyone to an extreme but I'm just trying to highlight the reality in which we exist because we don't even appreciate sometimes just how material we are well guy I'm a very simple guy I'm not a material person like we were we're talking to ourselves we're telling stories but the world has become so material that it's just so that it's just incessant incessant like you just look at the you want to know like what's going on in the minds of most people just look at the google search does look at the history on google search it's like the whole mind dumb you know everybody's typing all this stuff and you could you want to just know about ourselves we just what are we searching on google is it like honestly if you just took a you know you took you just took a history what did I search on google for the last five days and you just put it you took yourself out of the picture and just said what is this search is search is going to be all dunya it's all going to be dunya okay it's going to be a full of like every little thing that came to my mind that would entertain it this is a nature of the world that we exist in today again I'm not giving this story because I think it's hopeless I'm just reminding ourselves that like we make this big investment you know we we spend the time to make udu we spend the time to offer prayer we spend the time to join valuable gatherings we spend the time to sit in the company of our scholars we spend the time to expose ourselves and our hearts to the Quran but just appreciate that there's a preparation that goes into that those are all wonderful and excellent and hummed that hummed that we have that much it's such a great blessing all the last ponder del on this day and age and it suffices but I'm just saying that in order to be able to take the maximum advantage of that to really become the people that we hope to become not to read the stories of the past but to ignite the future that requires some preparation and by the way I mean it's a very very essential conversation not only for ourselves but it's an essential conversation for our families as well because how am I supposed to ignite the heart of my loved ones if my heart itself is like you know dead and not burning I can't transfer the passion of Islam to anyone if I don't have it within myself this is the beauty of the companions they caught the the passion of Allah's panel of Islam from the messengers of Islam and they it's like a bidirectional they they captured it and then they turned and they transmitted it and then those people captured it from them and turned and transmitted it so we have like a dual responsibility one is to capture it in this crazy world that we live in where you know you can capture everything but that and then the goal is to transfer that to all the people that we love and to transfer that to the people that we engage with the greater world I mean so many people in the world are looking for something bigger than what they exist in we're the we're the ones that carry that responsibility in our shoulders like do we really want to transfer to our kids you know how to have the most halal fun possible is that really the goal like this is here's here's all the ways that you can have fun but in the most halal way possible well what was the benefit of that that's the where they're living we want to transmit and we want to impassion their hearts with the love of Allah and that's never going to happen because we told them a bunch of stories or we told them they have to do a or they have to do b or you should do this or you should do that it's going to happen because our hearts themselves are passionate and our hearts themselves are transmitting which means what which means we have to do the nth degree of hijab we have to do the nth degree of hijab from the dunya we have to do we have to purify our hearts to the maximum ability possible and honestly that's where the whole challenge lies because once the heart is prepared you don't need more than one sunrise you don't need more than one word of the Quran one verse of the Quran you don't need more than one jama you don't need more than one prayer you don't need more than one sitting with one scholar if you're just your heart to ignite and and express Islam so the the challenge in Islam is not like how many retreats can I attend and how many different gatherings can I plug myself into yes those are important they're beneficial because when we have difficulty in lighting our own hearts each of these warms us each of these creates at least something that we can we can we can try to grab on but really the challenge lies in understanding that every one of these opportunities is significant enough each singular opportunity is significant to impassion the heart the battle lies in impassioning the heart and then can you just imagine like all the opportunities that are present around us the scholars the Quran the signs that are present around us the understanding that we have you would imagine that the depth of understanding that we have of the nature of the world around us would even further impassion our hearts the Sahaba had such a relatively simplistic understanding compared to the understanding of today we understand the nuanced science that underlies all of this and we only see further we see further organization and understand the degrees and layers of that organization which further mesmerizes but that wasn't what was required it's sufficient to just say the Sun rises and it was for the companions to have become impassioned by that once they understood its reality they didn't need all the technical details of the distance of the earth to the Sun and the angle and how many rays come in and how those rays travel through the atmosphere etc etc etc you can give a whole science lecture but they didn't need any that they just needed to know that the ground is this the sky is this the earth is this is such a relatively simple understanding but created such a passion in their hearts that we would literally die to have that passion and that's exactly the model that we take 1400 years later we're still chasing that model and and and and and using them as the model of the dean so here's where the battle wise and honestly it's such a simple challenge it's such a simple challenge it's just and it's simple in the sense that you don't need some PhD you don't need some long long degree you don't need some big courses it's so simplistic you just have to look at the heart you have to appreciate the power of the heart you have to say to yourself this is the mechanism of purification of the heart avoid sin make trouble when I do sin ask myself where am I arrogant humble myself before my lord avoid the dunya you know change my manners and my character etc these things these simple simple simple things that literally any person on the planet can understand if they're done then the heart will you don't need you don't need a big PhD to be able to you know understand the details of the tizqa it does get very straightforward and that's the preparation of the heart and if that exists everything else is down straight may Allah Allah SWT make us amongst those who can impassion who he impassions the heart with the dean and make us amongst those who are able to do the test-gave our hearts and may he keep us in the company of our scholars and may he keep us in the company of Bukhuran may he keep us in the company of the musjid may he keep us in the company of the pious such that we can continuously impassion our hearts and I'll go to the one I'm in the
