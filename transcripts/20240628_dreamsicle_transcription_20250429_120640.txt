جامسة الخاصة خاصة و I can tell you that when I give a lecture at the university it takes me like maybe 20 hours to prepare a 1 hour lecture و for example when I'm going to give a lecture this is the nature of being a professor when I have to give a lecture to students the first thing I do is I quickly make the lecture from the top of my head and then after I make the lecture from the top of my head سوف ننعود لungeةlatedellerادة وها 챌링 أنفس دائما امرا وتلاشاتoperation غير التعوالات كما ولا else ت 주� türで لا ترغبون وها تنظر quality ولكنت فقط فية دعوية يقومون دائما Chrysas اخرنا لكنة سيق ait ذامFORE Quan وإن West ومن المينر ديوز that I can appreciate that got changed along the way و that's one type of lecture و that's like the lecture that a professor gives and all professors when they give a lecture they're particularly if they have students that are smarter than them they're always worried about you know this lecture has to be at an on par with those students in that in that particular environment and I can tell you similarly just similarly when we do that to see which not an advertisement but I think it's happening next week and when we do that to see it it even takes me longer than that that the see your lecture that we have it's probably like an hour I think 45 minutes to an hour takes so much time to go through that because the nature of the material is such the audience is the same many of you attend that gathering as well but the nature of the material is such this gathering is the total opposite so I don't prepare this gathering even though my nature is like to prepare everything anyone who works with me knows I'm like always harping at every little dotting every eye and crossing every T but I purposely don't prepare this lecture and the reason is is because it's not meant to be a professor's lecture it's meant to be just an opportunity for us to sit together and I mean I don't think any of you when you sit with your families or when you sit with your friends I don't think any of you like prepare like what are we going to talk about you know when we all sit together if you meet friends after a long time what are you going to talk about so that's the nature of this of this gathering it's not a lecture it's a talk it's just meant to for me to be able to share some wisdoms or points that I come across throughout the week or if we haven't met for a couple weeks or over a couple of weeks and that has its own flavor it has its own benefits it's a different type of gathering and you'll notice that even just along those lines sometimes I meet people you know just I happen to bump into people and they'll tell me oh I listen to your you know to the lectures that you give on Fridays or Sundays you know this happens on on either day and then they'll sometimes say a really interesting point they'll say you know I when I go through them I can tell what was going on in your life as I go through them because like if I'm talking about house house house maybe I'm buying a house or if I'm talking about like I don't know by a car I tell some story about something you'll know which car I'm driving I don't know it's just it's just interesting so today today is a bit similar and but this time I'm going to tell you the event and then share maybe two possibly three three observations from that so we have a little pet I should not say have we had unfortunately he passed away we have a pet a rabbit his name is Dreamcicle and I promised my daughters I would give him full credit today so he so I don't love this week he happened to pass away and we had him for about six years and you know like honestly he literally became like an integral part of the family he had a different reaction with every person he would treat me one way he would treat different girls and my son a different way and my wife a different way and he had his unique characteristics so everyone had this kind of attachment to him so anyway he passed away this week and as he passed away it's been a few days now a couple days and there's a few things thoughts that came to my mind and I was just going to share them because they're on my mind actually it's three separate talks I could give this actually in three separate sessions but I don't know how much time we have today maybe I'll share one two or three points the first point is an interesting thing that actually I was reminded of not that I was triggered by this event to remember something that I was taught almost 20 years ago when I was when I was studying abroad and that is that this there was an instance a very famous or a very unique incident in the Sira which which came to mind in which Anas Raudhiy Allahu An informed the Prophet Sallallahu Alaihi Wasallam that his brother his younger brother actually half brother his younger half brother had a bird who passed away and there's a very famous incident in the Sira it's actually narrated in the major books of Hadith and the Prophet Sallallahu Alaihi Wasallam he depending on the narration but he consoled he went to this boy and he consoled this boy when this boy's pet passed away now this pet happened to be a bird but the boy was very sad for days and he was a young boy and the Prophet Sallallahu went to console this boy and the statement that he made to this boy is a very famous statement he said to him maffa ala nuhayr it's a kind of a rhyming type of phrase it has a rhyme to it ya aba nuhayr maffa ala nuhayr oh aba nuhayr what happened to nuhayr nuhayr means like the sparrow what happened to the sparrow meaning what happened to your bird and this was a little rhyme that the Prophet Sallallahu Alaihi and I'm shared with this boy and used to console this boy until eventually the boy was smiling at the end of the interaction and I was reminded of that circumstance particularly because this circumstance is an example now by the way what they teach you when you go to mother or when you study traditionally what they'll teach you is that one of the highlights when you're covering this hathith is that the scholars will tell you that dozens of masaih dozens of circumstances legal circumstances are generated from this one single statement this one interaction and actually the background to that is that some people used to criticize why would the Prophet Sallallahu Alaihi was saying why would the Prophet Sallallahu Alaihi was saying why would the Muslims let's say this way why would the Muslims include in their collection and narrations of the Prophet Sallallahu Alaihi was saying them such minute things like what this pet died this kid's pet the kid not even a kid's pet bird died and you're like relating this as some sort of like grand thing right Muslims are narrating this sharing this narration as if it's some sort of grand thing such this boy's pet died 1400 years ago and today I'm sitting and we're talking about it right it's kind of you think about it for a second like I just someone's pet dies pets pets die every day 1400 years ago this pet died and we're talking about it today but in response to this type of attitude of quote unquote the smallness of the event the scholars they derived massive numbers of issues and legal rulings from this single event for example the permissibility of keeping a pet the permissibility of having something for a child that makes them happy there's many many many things we're not going to go into that because this isn't a legal lecture but many of the scholars have generated many different issues from this one particular incident so Subhanallah it just goes to show you and now by the way Anasar O the Allah on in his narration what he starts the narration with Is he's using this to highlight the character of the prophesios on them he's using this example to highlight the character of The Prophet who on the Prophet Allah on the family companion a personal assistant of the prophet so he's using this to highlight the character of The Prophet judgment looked at the character of the prophesios on them the prophet, named character was such that he eveant went to give condolences to a child upon the dying يتبعونه في المنطلقات. لقد أحدث one thing that we encourage each other to give condolences when to an adult upon the dying of a family member. Correct? and that's a challenge for us. Like we're always reminding ourselves, call this person, give them condolences, make sure you go and meet this person, shake their hand, ask them how they're doing. I don't know if the Allah on is highlighting the character of the Prophet, by reminding us that the Prophet, by highlighting to us that the Prophet, may put them, actually give condolences to a child for the passing away of their pet, not a family member, the passing away of their pet and this goes to show you the deep interaction that the Prophet, may put them had with the companions even the youth and the children. It's not even youth children of that time. The Prophet, may put them, was keenly aware he's asking what happened with this boy. In fact, in one narration, وكما أدعي وأكبره ل sterile لسفعت أنه تت Pittsburgh هذا اللدي في العام و نفس الهنوة من هذا Adriatician philanبظ nósك و مدformation صبحان الله الثان覦 Fire لحب案 النعزة لحبه Benim تقول لحبه والشفحfamily عند گยر معرفة تقimes يمكن أن يكون مجدداً من المجدين here أعتقد أن كل شيء في هذا المجده كانت في مجده و when you go to a bookstore you'll see that there's different sections in the bookstore for example there's one section that's called not tragedy but there's one section that's called history, there's one section that's called mystery, there's one section that's called suspense, there's one section that's called adventure, there's one section that's entitled cooking and these sections are essentially all sections that capture some facet of life, right? because the sections have to relate if a human being is walking in the store and sees all the different sections and is attracted to one versus the other it's going to relate to the human being so for example you might go to the section on mystery and pick up a book and you might enjoy a book on mystery, you might go to the section on suspense or drama and pick up a book on suspense or drama, you might go to a section on investing in finance and pick up a book on investing in finance, every one of those books is going to be relevant and depending on the time and space that you find yourself in but even though a bookstore has all these different sections there's one section of life that everyone ends up at, right? we all experience suspense, we all experience mystery, we all experience self-help, financing, whatever it might be but everybody ends a tragedy and in a bookstore, in the end everyone will end a tragedy now why is it tragedy? because it's the nature of life everybody has to pass away and none of us can avoid that so in the end all of us have to remember one thing about this world and that's the one fundamental lesson that is so essential for a Muslim to appreciate and Subhanallah is one of the core messages of Ardine which is that this life inevitably ends in tragedy why tragedy? and what do I mean by that? it means that everyone has to pass every living thing has to pass and in particular every one of us has to pass and yeah you might experience all of us are going to experience different degrees of suspense and action and drama and mystery and cooking and finance and self-help and all the different sections that you might go through in a bookstore but in the end everyone ends up at tragedy because no matter the life that you live it will end and all living things are under the same circumstance the life is limited and that's such a key reminder for every person in this room in fact the Quran tells us that every soul kulu nafz, kulu nafz, that akhtolimot every soul is going to taste death it's a reminder to you and I and what that reminds us why that's important is because no matter what this life appears to be no matter what we amass, no matter what we gather no matter what we achieve, no matter what we experience no matter the lives that we establish for ourselves they're not permanent nor are they either lasting nor are they real it's just limited and so in the end no matter how perfect life is it always ends in death and that's in a way a tragedy you can't avoid it and people are going to vary it's like a maze everybody goes a different path but in the end everybody ends up at this one point and it's kind of interesting everybody starts at a point and what is that point called? it's called birth and everybody ends at a point that point is called death and then every person in this room will have a different path that eventually takes them from birth to death birth is common everybody has to be born, puts you into this world death is common everybody has to pass away moving out of this world and in between we call that life and this life no matter where we try to take it we cannot avoid this end point it doesn't matter we can try to go up we can try to go down we can try to go north south, east, west we can try to go in these different directions but this death is a magnet and birth is almost like a polar opposite birth pushes you towards death inevitably and death attracts you towards it until it grabs you at your time and your place and no one can avoid that and that's the case with the bird that died at the time that the child had and the pet that we happened to have that passed away and in fact it's the case with every one of us and we're always reminded of that and I think this is something that every single one of us needs to continuously think of now just as an example you know that the prophesies on them would regularly visit the graveyard of Medina and make the law for the people of the graveyard of Medina and remind himself and allow his companions to be reminded that he's eventually going to end up in that same state this was not like a rare occurrence for the prophesies on them in fact I shuddle the Allah on how she mentions that the prophesies on them used to regularly visit the graveyard of Medina towards the end of the night so she's relating the circumstance where the prophesies on them would be in her home and then the end of the night would pass the prophesies on them would spend time in prayer and towards the very end of the night it was his regular habit to go visit the graveyard and he would make the law in the graveyard and of course you know the famous doah where he would greet the people of the graveyard and at the end towards the middle or end of that doah were reminded that we're eventually going to be joining them as well but this is the constant reminder that's in the mind of the believer now why does a believer need that constant reminder so that they don't lose sense of these two points particularly the end point the biggest deception is to think that something in the middle is real something in the middle is not real it is just a mechanism to get somewhere else it is a path towards a final destination that destination is death none of us can avoid the fact that we are going to pass away and when we calculate decision when we calculate how we're behaving when we make decisions when we think about how we're going to organize our lives this always needs to be at the forefront because this is what passes us into the true reality which is the hereafter and as you know death is the one filter through which nothing can pass when they make filters in the world they're always based on the micr... the micron size of particles that can pass through you know they'll say this filter is so good that only particles less than one micron can pass through or this filter is so good that it filters 99.9999% of this and that but death is such a filter that it filters 100% of dunya from it cannot take wealth, cannot take your friends you cannot take your goods, you cannot take your business you cannot take your degrees, you cannot take your kids you cannot take your relationships you take nothing death filters everything at the door and only allows your soul to cross in fact you can't even take your body it's your body, it's your vehicle that you've been riding for 30, 40, 50, 70 years you cannot even take your body the body goes into the ground exactly where it came from and the soul is the only thing that's allowed to cross and when the soul crosses it then meets the only other thing that we actually are able to do in this world which is to generate good deeds and it's these good deeds that eventually will determine what the consequence will be after death now such a simple concept but honestly so difficult to keep in the forefront because the nature of the world is that it glitters and glows and the nature of the people of the world is that they tend to talk up the world they all talk up the world but death is so obvious that all you have to do is look around you and you'll see that death is continuously occurring and that I mean if I say to everyone if I say to you in this room today that you know a hundred years from now if you come to this gathering let's say there's a gathering in the must of the hundred years from now and none of these faces will be here no one will disagree it's such a stark truth such a reality and no one in this room will disagree but we fail to appreciate its true nature which is to live according to that concept which is that I am a traveler I'm passing through this place I have a purpose and then I the real circumstance of the real consequence of life will only be seen after death so this is the second lesson that sort of I was reminded of and the third lesson is a really interesting lesson and to understand this lesson you have to be a little familiar with rabbits so I'll tell you that rabbits they're usually the hunted they're not hunting they're usually being hunted in the wild and by the way I don't know if I mentioned but our pet was a rabbit but he was living in the house he was domesticated so anyway but rabbits are normally hunted they're not hunters meaning you know different different animals will hunt them so one of the defense mechanisms they have multiple defense mechanisms one is that they'll tend to like hiding corners or bury themselves in the dirt they'll cover themselves as much as they can to protect themselves but one very interesting mechanism that they have for their defense is that they keep themselves super clean super clean so much so that they're constantly calming their fur and you never have to give them a shower or a bath and they keep themselves so clean that if you feel their fur or you look at their fur it's completely white now sometimes rabbits will have different patterns but it's completely clean particularly in the way the most evident areas of that is the white fur that they have and I knew this when we first got the rabbit they gave us like a little introductory two-three page paper on the rabbit in my typical nature I started studying and reading it trying to understand all the things about this rabbit but anyway in that paper they had mentioned it but I had forgotten I had forgotten I read it years ago this is a six-year-old rabbit now so I read this maybe six years ago and I was just remembering but how did it come to my mind because when we were doing the burial we had to put the rabbit in the ground and then eventually we put the dirt on the rabbit and when the dirt came on the rabbit's fur I saw that contrast right away you know I saw the contrast how clean this fur is how crystal clean this fur is so pure, so clean, white and there's like this dirt on this fur and how the rabbit would be so particular about not even allowing a speck of dirt to come on it and at that moment when I saw that picture in my head that snapshot is still there actually that I took this snapshot and I began remembering that paper that I read that how clean they used to keep them how clean why they keep themselves so clean because they keep themselves why they keep themselves clean so there's not even a smell that animal can detect them that's why I don't know if I said that but that's why they're keeping themselves so clean they want that they're so clean that there's not even a tiny scent that comes from their body because if that scent is detected by a fox for example the fox will find them so they have to be ultra clean and when I saw the dirt against the rabbit's body during the burial then I appreciated just how pristine that was and I was reminded of this and then I started thinking so I don't know if this is the case of a rabbit and they're purity what about us? right? I mean you see the emphasis in our Dean on keeping our hearts pure and honestly purity engenders further purity and this is something that one important lesson that we can all take which is that we should never tolerate any degree of blemish on our hearts or our souls and you know that every time we create a sin a little black dot arises on the heart but maybe what we don't appreciate is that every time we have one black dot on the heart the second one becomes easier and if you have two the third one becomes easier and if you have three the fourth and fifth and sixth become easier it's only when the hearts kept ultra pure ultra crystal clean that a person then recognizes how pure it actually is and will further maintain that purity or maybe another way you can think about it is if there's purity there's very little in there's very little there's a little back the background for Shethan to be able to take hold becomes less right? it's in the context of filth and it becomes easier for Shethan to be able to take us to further filth so you know if a rabbit is literally I mean almost like he's spending time every day making his tukfa you know I cleaning his nice not literally making his tukfa what you understand with the figurative example I'm giving is like taking every extra moment to remove every single possible you know defect from his fur in order to keep it so pure that he's not picked up by a predator although there's no even predator and he's in a house he's like very well protected but I mean if that's the case of a rabbit then what's the case with our hearts? in fact this is the job of a Muslim and it's already inherently built into Islam every time we pray the sins are wiped away every time we make wudu the sins are wiped away every time we fast the month of Ramadan for example all the sins between that and the prior Ramadan are wiped away when we go for al-Mu'ra the sins are wiped away when we pray Jumah the sins are wiped away etc. so Islam inherently is always reminding us it's always resetting us all we have to do is like in between these little tiny spaces of windows where we don't necessarily are not necessarily taking advantage of all of the other things that are built into our deen we have to make a little bit of a stukfa and a little bit of toba in fact the prophet I said that he mentioned a very beautiful narration he says sometimes I feel a bit of a haze over my heart he's speaking sometimes I he's speaking so I send them feel a little haze over my heart and I make a stukfa 70 times a day so if that's the case of the prophet I said and I had two things we learned a couple of things we learned from that number one the prophet I said I'm constantly perceiving his heart right? I mean to appreciate that there's a haze there it has to be so subtle that and the prophet I said it has to be completely in tune with it that he picks it up whatever that might be and we can't even begin to fathom I mean the prophet I said it's you know completely protected even from making mistakes sending or making mistakes so we can't fathom this but just it's a lesson for you and I which is that the prophet I said it's clearly in tune with his heart he's appreciating that there's some sort of change whatever that might be and he's immediately making his stukfa in the context of that appreciation in order to ensure that his heart remains absolutely pure so what's our case? what's our situation? our minds should always be attentive to our hearts because we are not guaranteed that we will never make a mistake we in fact are continuously making mistakes so it means that we have to be even more vigilant about looking over our hearts number one number two anytime we appreciate something that doesn't belong in that heart any speck of dirt any speck of dust any speck of blemish we should immediately make a stukfa and to the extent that we should consistently make a stukfa 70 times, 100 times, dozens of times however you want to interpret that a day this is something that you and I must continuously pursue and like I said that's one of the lessons that I also was able to I take from this circumstance and I'm just sharing it with all of you as well so anyway the summary is three things number one the unique and amazing death of the Syrah that even what is apparently such a simple circumstance is captured within it and from it our scholars they're able to generate so many important lessons and in particular the great highlight of the character of the Prophet I sent him that he was so in tune not just with the adults and not just with the major events but with even such a circumstance where a kid his pet dies and the Prophet I sent him is there to console that child number one number two just the nature of our lives which is that it is in the end tragedy I don't debate that there are many, many nice things that can happen in life I don't debate that we can enjoy certain food and drink and certain lifestyles and certain possessions and certain assets and certain relationships but I think we can all agree that irrespective of the volume of each of those if you just have buttons and you're setting volumes irrespective of the volume of each of those everybody's going to be muted at the end everyone is going to be muted at the end none of us can avoid this and none of us knows when our time is coming but I can guarantee and you know there's no, I don't even need to guarantee it so obvious our time is extremely limited it's the nature of this life it is ends in tragedy tragedy just temporary because this world you can't take what you thought was real the people you will leave behind people who will be sad of course once you get past it then you begin to experience the true bliss which is the ahirah and then lesson number three was just this reminder of the important security just as a rabbit protects themselves against their predator by keeping themselves ultra pure we too have a predator of course it's shethan and the more we keep our hearts pure the less likely shethan is to have any type of nitice to be able to influence us, influence us to derail us, to misguide us, to attack us, etc it's only in the face of impurity that shethan can take hold and when the hearts appear it's very very hard for shethan to be able to even find a crevice in which he can grab and influence us so we should be extremely adamant and extremely vigilant I should say in ensuring that we maintain the utmost purity of our heart and of course the purity of the heart always occurs through is tqfar and if Antoba if it's something major but is tqfar especially throughout the day and how many times do we remind ourselves that we should be making is tqfar throughout the day whether that's in the morning or in the evening or maybe a few times after every prayer or whatever cadence you feel that you can be consistent but it's so important. Mellos Panwattala allow us to be able to appreciate the reality of our circumstance for making Mekos amongst those who are able to appreciate the greatness of the Sunnah to take lessons of the Sunnah to embed the character of the Prophet's Hellumwin into our own lives. Mellos Panwattala make us amongst those who are able to appreciate the final consequence of each of our lives such that we're able to behave in a way that's relevant both in this world and in the next. Mellos Panwattala grant us purity of the heart such that we're able to appreciate even the most minor blemish when it arises in our hearts and souls. Wakhirat-ta'ala anilhamdulillahirrahmanirrah
