 MawlAllah, Rabb al-Alamin, Moussalaatun, wa salam ala Rasul al-Kireem, amma bad. Allahu masallahu ala sallam, المحague sonst at the same time, they say in Allah imam al-Sallam, decidings amid the news. Allah分 slas but Allah entering behaviors. state of service that should be present within each and every one of us. And this is like one of the core features of a Muslim. And you see the world around us and you see many of the unfortunate circumstances that we as a community, as an, as an omna find ourselves in. And there are many reasons for it, some of which perhaps we understand and some of which perhaps we don't understand. One of the main reasons is that we have lost our sense of service. Meaning that we let the world blow us in the direction that it's moving in. What is the direction of the world today? You'll see that the world is very focused on how can I be served? How can I be served? For example, you'll see that the dean of the people today is if you had to categorize the way that people behave and what motivates them, what drives them, you'll see that it's this whole notion of happiness. For example, there's a different classes that have a reason recently, one at Harvard, one at Yale, and other places as well, on happiness. In fact, the class at Yale, on happiness, is the most sought after class in the undergrad level of all the classes at Yale. Can you imagine that people are spending $60,000, $70,000 a year as an undergrad at Yale. They worked their whole life to get there. Essentially, they worked so hard all through, even before high school, but particularly through high school. Eventually, they get to Yale, and the most popular class at Yale is this class on happiness. If you think about it, the reason that people are so in tune with this notion of happiness today is because they're really asking the question, how can I be happy? In the happiness class, there's not a lecture on how do you make other people happy. That's not what the focus of that class is. Focus of that class is what will make me happy. This has become the dominant theme of today, which is that how can I be happy? How can I be satiated? How can I be contented? How can I be served? All of these ideas are very, very common. This is slowly crept into us as well. When I say us, what I mean is that the Muslim Ummah is a whole. This is also crept into us. What's happened is we've looked at Islam and we say, how can Islam make me happy? How can Islam make me happy? And there's nothing wrong with that per se, because Islam will make a person happy. But that's not the notion of a Muslim because the Muslim recognizes that even if they were to attain perfect happiness in this life, this life will end. So if the goal of life was to just achieve the highest level of happiness, then you still hit a dead end. Now, you have to understand that most of the world is teaching principles that lead you through the maze of life. So you wake up in the morning and there's all these choices. It's like a maze. You know, I'm going to turn here, then I'm going to turn here, I'm going to turn here, I'm going to turn here. You never really get to see where they end lies. It's funny because you talk to people who seemingly achieve such heights in life. And the funny thing is that they'll often tell you that they were much happier at the beginning than when they eventually got to the goal that they thought was so high for them. For example, I commonly do this because I'm in the role of medicine, right? So I'm teaching students who, you know, worked their whole life to get to medical school and eventually these people worked their whole life to become doctors. But when you catch them at 50, right? And all of that's disappeared and this whole idea of I need to become a doctor at all costs and I'm going to do everything in my power to get it to be a doctor. Everybody around me, my whole life told me I have to become a doctor. It was like as if there was some sort of like, you know, pot at the end of this rainbow, right? But when you really catch them at that age where they've actually achieved all of that and then they've had the opportunity to experience that success, they often tell you the same thing, which is that, well, I got here, but actually I realized that there's no here, here. Right? And it's funny because essentially what they're really saying is I went through the maze of life only to find out that I actually hit a dead end. That's the convoluted maze of life. And eventually people guide you or give you advice or tell you where to go or how to do things in life, but eventually they're leading you through this maze and the vast majority of paths. In fact, I would say all the pets lead to some dead end or another. For example, if the purpose of life was just happiness, right? If the purpose of our life was just happiness, then you'll get, you may reach the very end of that maze, but you're still going to realize that that leads to a dead end. Why? Because death will come and death will cut off that happiness and eventually a person will go to the grave and they will have to face the consequences of their life and the grave. And that may not necessarily be happiness if a person pursued happiness in this world, because why? This world is not a place of reward. This world is a place of test. So if it's like a high school student says to you, why do I have to take final exams? I'm not happy. Now, in fact, that's what they're doing. They're telling you many students, you don't even have to take final exams anymore. Many high schools have canceled final exams because the students are not happy when they take final exams. They're too stressed. I'm not a proponent of stressing people out, but my point still remains that the goal of life is not happiness. Happiness comes in jannah. It's a consequence of life. We don't seek happiness in this world. We seek happiness in the hereafter. We don't seek reward in this world. We seek reward in the hereafter. We're not looking to be contented and served in this world. We're looking to be contented and served in the hereafter. Now, does that mean that a person can't be happy in this life? There are circumstances where a person can be happy in this life, but it's not the purpose. We don't make decisions based on how can I maximize my happiness in this world? But that's become the dominant theme of today. That's become the dominant of the theme of today. Everybody's reading all these blogs on how they can become happier. Everybody wants to watch podcasts on how they can become happier. You put out a book. You just call it happiness, you know, exponential happiness, and you'll just sell copies just from the title. Because that's the whole theme of the world in which we exist. But if we let that creep into our lives and we're always asking the question, how can I be served? How can I be happy? How can this person treat me the way that I want to be treated? And we're only going to end up at the same dead end that the vast majority of the world will end up at. The goal for us in this world is not happiness. The goal for us in this world is service. We are a people who take, we fill ourselves with the love and remembrance of Allah's Kana wa Ta'ala. And then we recognize that even that is not the final goal. That the final goal is to take that, what I call, potential energy and convert that into the kinetics of service of the rest of the world. Because every moment of service of the rest of the world is in essence the mechanism by which we perpetuate our happiness in the hereafter. For example, if I can put a smile on another person's face, insha'Allah Allah will put a smile in mind. If I can forgive another person in this world, insha'Allah Allah will forgive me on the day of judgment. If I can give and clothe others in this world, I can feed others and clothe others in this world, Allah will feed me and clothe me in the hereafter. So it's a completely upside down paradigm. Meaning it's not upside down. It's the opposite. It's a reverse paradigm. And we have to appreciate that and we can't let this notion come into our heads that I need to be served. And in fact, you see this. This is crept into the community. We want to make sure that we have the best food and we have the best clothing and we have the best dwellings and we have the best vehicles. And somehow we see that as a success. But success does not come through those things. Those are all dead ends. And the beauty of it is that we've been given a straight path. And look, Sapanallah, we say that we have this serothal, Musnaqim, we have this straight path. And what is this straight path? This straight path takes us straight through the maze. You know, we call it the maze of multiplicity. There's this maze of multiplicity out there. Everything leads you to a dead end. No matter how much people hype it up, no matter what people say about it, no matter how seemingly happy the people look. You know the truth about society. If you get a little bit older, you recognize that everybody puts on a smile, particularly on social media, but the vast majority of those people are just smiling in the pictures, but inside they're not. So this straight path that we've been given is the straight path that leads you through this maze. It's the one path that isn't a dead end. Because it's the one path that leads to a lost panorataala and it's that which leads to a lost panorataala, which leads to success, I should say, which results in success in this world in the next. So we're not going to ask the question, how can you serve me? Why can't this person serve me and this person treat me this way and this person do this for me? We're asking the opposite question. We're asking the question in every circumstance. How can I go out there and put a smile on every person's face? And that's not an easy thing to do. But that's what results in reward. That's the challenge of life. What happens is a lost panorataala gives you an opportunity to connect yourself to him and then every time we get an opportunity to connect ourselves to him in some way, a test will come upon us and that test will often be a test of service or interaction with others and then based on the way in which we behave in those interactions, then a lost panorataala will open the next door to be able to gain his proximity. If you look at the Syra, many people will talk about the Syra and there's many things you can say about the Syra but one way to think about the Syra is that it's just an oscillation between what I call retreat and reality. I've given this talk before but anyways, we're repeating here, retreat and reality. What is retreat? Retreat is when you get to huddle and you get to focus on a lost panorataala. You'll see that Sahaba that would retreat into the company of the Prophet's I said them and they would be just to focus on Allah so they would be able to focus on their vicar, focus on their Qur'an, focus on their love of the Prophet's I said them, they would just be huddled around him but invariably, after every circumstance of retreat would come another circumstance in which they would be tested. For example, what is the buddha except a test? What is the buddha except a test? What is hunduk except a test? etc. You can go through this. You're going to find this oscillation, this period of relative stillness and then this period of having to struggle and sacrifice. Then another period of relative stillness and then another period of having to struggle and sacrifice. The whole see and it just unulates between this. That's a lesson to all of us. The goal in and of itself isn't the vicar of Allah. The goal is that we take that proximity that we gain to Allah, that connection that we gain to Allah, and that we reciprocate that when we go out into the world and it becomes a mechanism by which we gain the maximum reward by going out there and struggling and striving in the service of the Hein. This has to be the primary objective of every Muslim. And as I mentioned a few weeks ago and I'm repeating today because to me this is the dominant message that we who needs to be repeated over and over again until it's embedded in our hearts is that we have to become that the Quran as I mentioned last time, that the Quran is essentially really just a recollection or you can say a capturing of the examples of the people who served the cause of Allah. I mean think about a billion of people have crossed the planet, billions of people, billions, I mean there's currently billions of people on the planet but historically billions and billions of people have crossed through this life. But the Quran is just taking a snapshot of a very small handful of them. It's taking a snapshot of this group or this group or this person or that person or this community or that person. It's a handful but they all have one similar characteristic. They were out there servicing the deen of Allah. They were out there servicing the deen of Allah and when we read those circumstances they're not stories that we tell our children as we put to bed. They're not stories like some sort of Netflix we're just watching and we're just entertaining ourselves. They're meant to inspire us. They're meant to inspire us to cause us to ask the question, I wish I could be there. I'll just give you one simple example from the Syedah, maybe a couple from the Quran but one definitely from the Syedah. Look at the, there's one very beautiful snapshot of the Syedah which is where everyone in the room knows it but it's where it's just reflecting on for a minute. You know that after the conquest of Makkah and there was a battle and after that battle there was a conquest of Makkah which was essentially no bloodshed in order for Makkah to be conquered and soon there after there was another battle near Makkah. I'm not going to go into the details right now but essentially there was a victory after some struggle, there was a victory there and a massive amount of wealth came into the Ummah and the Prophet of the time said I'm just distributed that wealth. I mean without even thinking knowing it was well there was as if water was being distributed literally wealth was handed on everywhere. And on Sahr they began to whisper amongst themselves that you know like okay the Prophet of the time had a love for Makkah, Prophet of the time is treating the people of Makkah in this way, he's giving them so much of this wealth etc. So perhaps he may actually you know now relocate himself to Makkah. And eventually when the word came to the Prophet of the time he gathered together the companions and particularly on Sahr and this was actually just for the on Sahr and he asked them the quite after recognizing their circumstance he said to them that you know does it not please you that these people are being given whatever the camels and the wealth and that you are going to take home the messenger of Allah. And this was a very high point in the in the Syirah and it was a very very unique circumstance in which even the unsolved themselves they you know wept at that circumstance because they recognized that they had actually that all of these were just the goods of the world and people had taken were taking the goods of the world but they were going to take home the messenger of Allah and they recognized that their sacrifice that actually resulted in something very special. Now my point that I'm trying to make here is that when the Prophet of the time sent them had to select in the end even after his home was retaken and he had said that he had wished that he could stay there when he had left that city he said there was no place more beloved to him but when in the very end when it came to deciding where he would remain and even then eventually where he would be buried he went back with the on Sahr. He went back with the who are the on Sahr the helpers of the deen. On Sahr essentially they're titled they had many characteristics but the name that we give them is the has the helpers right essentially they took this responsibility upon themselves they said to themselves as part of their commitment to the Prophet of the time that we will service this deen with everything that we have they made made they made they were the ones that made Yathrib Medina they were the ones that made it Medina now of course people came right people came to that city they migrated to that city they made the Hidjara to that city but they that that notion of their service was what essentially what what found was what was how that entire city was founded and how the Prophet of the time he eventually chose them when even even Mekha had become reconquered. So here you learn a very very even from the example of the Syrah the very end stage of the Syrah that very final stage you're learning a very important thing which is that who takes home the messenger it's always on them who's going to keep the messenger who's going to keep the proximity of the messenger so I said them it's going to be those people who are going to be servants of this thing the helpers of this thing and this is the same statement by the way which is recollected in the Quran centuries before centuries before when Isha Ali sent on stood before his companions and said Man Ansari il Allah it's quoted in the Quran he said to them who are my helpers for the sake of Allah and by the way well like I said I mentioned a few weeks back when I'm repeating again today like I said at that point when we read that it's not a story it's like an inspiration I mean honestly when you when that question arises in that way we should all jump out of our seats we should all jump up and say like I mean I wish I was there and that's exactly the thought that should be going through the mind of every person I wish I was there I wish that when Isha Ali's sannam had called upon those people to become servants of the deen to become the helpers of the deen Ansari il Allah to become the helper his helpers in the deen I wish I could have raised my hand and I wish I could have been there and so many times people say if I was a companion if I was present at the time of the Prophet I sent them you're not though but that doesn't mean that you can't take on that one characteristic that one characteristic which would have connected us to the Prophet I sent them and would have been required if we were present at that time we wouldn't have been able to make those sacrifices it's Allah is mercy that a little bit of distance was created but that one characteristic which defined where the Prophet I sent them ended up eventually this is the characteristic that we should embed in ourselves which is that we should start we should not be sitting around and waiting for the world to serve us we should be standing up and ask the question how can I serve this deen the other way as I mentioned a few weeks ago the other way to look at this is who's to take hers and who's the givers why do we want to be takers we want to come into the muskid we want to take the benefit of the muskid we fail to ask the question why am I able to benefit from the muskid if we're able to benefit from any muskids from any organization from any circumstance it's why it's because there's a group of people that are out there servicing that to create the opportunity that allows everybody to be able to benefit so the question isn't how can I benefit the question is how can I serve by the way this is even the famous quote from American history I'm going to misquote it probably but it's the famous quote from American history ask not what your country can do for you ask what you can do for your country now it gets put on every museum in America but this is like the message from way before that right the question isn't what can America can do for you the question is what you can do for America that's the the quote that's being stated but essentially it's the same concept which is what don't ask what how what I can take ask what I can give and the dean bellowa because the dean even more so we should not be sitting around asking what can the dean give me we should be sitting around and asking where can I give every drop of blood where can I give every tear where can I give all my sweat where can I give all my wealth where can I give my time that's what allows a person to be able to achieve the highest echelons of dean and by the way it's not predicated on I need to know this I need to go study so many books I need to go do no no that's not what's required the Sahaba were very the Sahaba just simply came and presented themselves to the prophesies and the prophesies and the leveraged each of them to be able to create a group of people that we all upon whose shoulders all of us stand so we shouldn't create preconditions for ourselves like okay I'm not really qualified I don't really know that much I'm not able to do this I'm not able to do that I'm not so pious as the rest of the people no that's not the that's not the criteria there's no resume required here the only one criteria that's required is for a person to just recognize that it's not about me being served it's about how I can serve others and if a person can just embed that simple concept in their mind it completely flips the narrative of how the world works because I don't know if I said this last time the whole world runs on one or two percent of people I know that there's a billions and billions of people on the planet but the whole world is running on one percent meaning 99% of the people are takers they're going to benefit and just do whatever they do and there's one percent of the people even one percent is an overestimate to be honest with you there's one percent of people that are running the whole planet they are the ones that are out there making the sacrifices struggling and actually in the domains that we care about it's probably even less than that right because I'm not trying to inspire you to become an NBA basketball player right so there's many domains that you can just eliminate they're not they're not of concern for us because they're not the goal that we have set before ourselves so it doesn't take a lot of people to affectuate a change in the world but it does take a lot of determination on the part of a small number of people to be able to create a change in the world so this is the first step like if our goal is going to be like you know what when's the next halal restaurant opening up and let's make sure that we all go try it then it's over you will open lots of halal restaurants I have no doubt about that that'll all happen you know and but that's exactly what will become you know what's the benefit of that but if the goal is to ask the harder question which is that Allah's panatullah has blessed me with a b and c what am I going to do with those blessings how am I going to create an opportunity to be able to serve with those blessings then so panatullah the community can achieve a tremendous amount and honestly I look at the community and I have a very broad way of looking at things and I look at the community particularly like the American Muslim community and I just see like a tiny tiny tiny tiny number of people now the community likes to celebrate the number of misogyn that they have and go to fundraising dinner they see 500 people in a room they see a hundred dollar they see a thousand people in the room or they see five thousand people at either prayer they get very excited it's that is nothing that can be swept away with one wave the tiny fraction the tiny tiny tiny fraction and to make some sort of assumption that we're like planted and stable and that nothing can we can withstand anything that's a gross overestimation of the status of the community no this is a fledging community which can easily be blown away by the wind and the only way this community will thrive will be through the sacrifice of every person I mean every person has to recognize that they had carry a responsibility my sacrifice here I don't mean sacrifice for my own interests I mean sacrifice for the sake of the dean for the interest of raising the name of Allah's panatullah and spreading this message to every single person that it can be spread to so that requires that as a community the whole community come together and create this notion of service within them and it doesn't need to be complicated service it could be as simple as just smiling at the neighbor next door to you or as simple as handing out food to the people who are in need and they don't need to be Muslim even by the way but it's just until that that paradigm is shifted right this paradigm of how can I be served how can I collect as much as possible how can I have as much as possible until that paradigm shifted it's very hard to move to more yeah we'll be able to have some successes and Allah's panatullah the buttercup the dean and the the law of the prophet's ice item and we'll be able to carry us through I'm not doubting that but we certainly will not have achieved our potential and we individually will not have been able to achieve the maximum reward that was available to us we have a very unique opportunity to be able to to do lots for the sake of the for it's the sake of ourselves and the service of the dean but it requires that we completely change the paradigm in which we we look at things and that's by the way you don't want to you don't have to look further than yourself in the mirror because every person in this room is going to be able to trace their Islam back to something and that is the tracing of their Islam back to something is always going to be predicated on on somebody who made some sacrifice many of us who knows where we would be or what we would be worshipping you travel the world and you see people worship so many different things and have so many different ways by which they try to achieve an understanding of the universe and this straight path is so special and so unique and the more you reflect on it and the more you think about it and even after so many years you know of having received an education and having fought through Western philosophy and Eastern philosophy and all these last few every time I come back and try to break down all of these different ideologies and I look back at Islam as a straight path it's such a blessing it's such a blessing but the question is how did it come it came because somebody before me sacrificed somebody had made some sort of struggle with and instead of thinking about themselves they actually made the effort to go and tell someone someone in my lineage about the dean and it doesn't just come from handing out a pamphlet it comes from like truly living the dean sacrificing struggling Allah's Qawla's al-Aseez that a person's making effort day in and day out and day in and day out and the buttica of that effort is a door is open so it's not so simple as they just picked up the phone obviously there were no phones hundreds of years ago but that they simply just told somebody about Islam and a person accepted it no they became trumel sums themselves they took the circumstances of stability and used it to build themselves and their knowledge of dean their understanding of dean their connection with Allah and every time an opportunity came to serve they would then sacrifice and be tested through that service until that would allow them to be able to regain their connection with Allah or deepen their connection with Allah which would allow them to take the next step of service so this is a very very very important understanding that all of us should appreciate we should not be so blinded to think that this goal of our life is our happiness I agree the goal of life should be happiness but should be the happiness of others we should desire to bring every person into into this dean for the sake of their happiness not not bringing people into the dean because it makes me feel good by the way even our Dawa often is just for our own happiness somebody comes in the masjid they accept Islam we become happy we hug them greet them thank them and then they leave and most people don't think twice about where they were so then the question is what were we really concerned about the person who came in the door or were we more concerned about us being happy that they came in the door there's a big difference right because now I feel good because somebody else agrees with what I think or I'm a minority I didn't really feel respected so now I'm happy that somebody else came in and joined my minority makes me feel like one we've increased by one that's not what we're talking about here we're talking about having more concern for all of humanity than we have for ourselves I gave this example before here I don't know where I mentioned it but just it's about all I'm talking too much but let me just finish this thought and then we'll stop but so I don't look at the verse of Quran concerning how the prophesies and the prophesies and the desire for humanity I could give a separate talk on this another time but fa'ala alaqabah ki o'unnefsaka ala a'athadi him in the mjukminu biha'dan havihi sfah subhanallah the Quran is saying to the prophesies and them per chance you will annihilate yourself per chance you will annihilate yourself with your concern over humanity this is how concerned the prophesies and the ones but look at the wording if you have such a strong let's just establish one thing the prophesies and them had such a concern for all of humanity that he sacrificed and struggled and used every circumstance in order to be able to serve as humanity this was his desire and this kept him up at night and this brought his tears this is what released the tears from his eyes this is what caused the sweat to come from his forehead and this is what caused on those circumstances where it happened for his blood to be shed right so this was what he embedded in his companions and this was the struggle that they made this concern for all of humanity that there should be no corner of the earth except that they have been exposed to la ilaha illa Allah Muhammad ala Rasulullah but look at the way the Quran expresses that fa'ala alaqabah ki o'unnefsaka ala a'athadi him so ala a'athadi him means upon their footsteps so the way i've given this example before it's going to be a butchering of the beauty of it but just you know imagine that you're trying to convince someone of something okay you are you want you are talking to them directly so you are facing them and you're trying to convince them okay so you have that much concern okay now imagine take this one step further imagine that this is the person that you're trying to convince here imagine that they turn their back to you but you still have so much love and concern that you're trying to convince them with your utmost effort and as if you're about to annihilate yourself because you have so much care now imagine that they walk away and there's just their footsteps on the ground and you are standing crying over their footsteps and almost about to annihilate yourself over concern on their footsteps this is what the Quran is saying the status of the prophet says and concern for humanity alaqabah alaqabah ki o'unnefsaka ala a'athadi him you are about to annihilate yourself over their footsteps over their footsteps you're that much concerned about them that they're like long gone their footsteps are sitting in the sand and you're concerned that they left and they're long gone this was the love of the prophet's law for all of humanity and this is what this is this is the love of the people who are of the community of the prophet's law they will take every opportunity they can in the greatest wisdom in in in in in a way that's extremely wise because of that concern right they're not forcing anything because they want that message to be given to the person they have such a love for the person that they will do it with such wisdom that they spread this message far and wide and all you have to do is travel the world and you're going to go to every corner with different corners of the world you're looking at this culture that culture this continent that continent to this language that language all these people are most like and you're just wondering how how did this happen you know from from where from one man in a so law is sent them in a desert who receives a message in a cave with no technology to this exponential spread throughout history such that geographies are changed out of every continent as the striving Islam present in it within it it's a complete cultures have been overturned it's so final that's absolutely phenomenal but it didn't just come because I don't know where it didn't come out of thin air it came from service these people came into Dean and they didn't take they actually became the ones from whom we take from I mean think about it you say Imam Bukhari who's Imam Bukhari where's he in relation to Mekka where where's his hometown in relation to Mekka I mean so far so distant such a different culture yet he not only his predecessors not only became Muslim but they turned around and asked the question how they could serve the whole Ummah so that today Imam Bukhari's book is being read in Mekka it's amazing that the people who came into the Dean contributed to the Dean so much that it actually returned back to the house of the Dean you see the picture where are we where are we we're just caught up in ourselves we're caught up in our own bubbles we're so worried about ourselves all our energy goes into like fighting with one another we're fighting with our spouses we're fighting with our kids we're fighting with our relatives because it's like why can't you serve me you're not serving me you know my spouse is not serving me my uncle's not treating me the way I should be treated my kids they're not doing you know we've got all these complaints all you know how many battles can one person fight you fight fight fight fight with your spouse you're so tired there's no energy left you have no energy to serve Dean right you're fight fight fight with your uncle fight fight with your aunt fight with your parent fight with your cousin fight with your brother fight with your sister like six front war countries don't even survive a two front war read military history countries don't even suffer so rarely survive a two front war we got six fronts going on and then we're like standing up and trying to serve as Dean it doesn't work that way this attitude has to be completely reversed it has to be how can I serve everyone the process of them's there like in the home he's serving the home in the family he's serving the family in the community he's serving the community and he's in his dreams he's serving the world and his dreams what I mean is in his thinking in his thinking he's serving the world and creating a group of companions that do the exact same so it's all I said so that's got to be the attitude of every Muslim we should be asking the question how can we serve and then there's no like prerequisite that you got to like submit a resume and get get admitted no you come into Dean you take this basic shahada you know the basic level of the shahada and then you take the opportunities that you can whether that's in the muskish or in a gathering or in a particular circumstance that becomes the food it becomes the fuel and then you go out there and you serve every person that you can even just service silent service is sufficient to be able at least by the capital that's in the political capital social capital that's necessary to be able to bring someone into the deep but again if the the goal of the omma is to serve ourselves like you know how many halal chicken places can I create open up and how many how many places have I visited and where can I get the best pizza and then we're we're gonna be seeing we're gonna see the results we're gonna see the results we're shooting ourselves in the foot I'm not saying that we can't enjoy with our family of certain amenities and I'm not saying that that may not that there aren't people out there that are creating those amenities for us it's fine that's part of establishing any community but that can't be the goal we can't be what wakes us up in the morning what puts us to better know what causes us to drive an hour from our homes we won't drive an hour from our homes for anything except if it means it's some sort of service to me there are many many many many many opportunities to serve we should put ourselves in the center of those every your local must you wherever you live your local must you you should be a servant in that must you in the families we all have families we should be servants in our families starts there start there be being servants in our families having a concern about who's in the house who are the members of the house who's living in my house what do I have to do to serve each one of them if everyone is serving you know everybody has that attitude of service and it's never going to be perfect that everybody has that attitude of service but if the idea is that I have no expectation from anyone my only hope is that I can serve my expectation is with a lot that's a completely different way of thinking but if the question is going to be you know we need to go sit and somebody needs to explain to each of us how we can each you know how each of us can make each other happy and often doesn't result in anything and it's not what creates if it does lead you anywhere it's eventually going to lead to a dead end because there's one straight path and that path takes us to a lost kind of a dollar but that path is completely lined with service it's lined with recognizing that every penny in our pocket is a mechanism not by which we feed and clothe and enjoy our own lives but by which we can elevate the lives of those in need that's all this is every dollar we're given is just a big test yes we have the right to be able to spend it on our families and ourselves and not even saying that that's wrong it's it's something that actually is part of our dean to service our families to spend on our families but the goal should always be to attain the maximum reward possible so that we can attain the maximum happiness in the year after that's the only place of happiness every every every other happiness is a dead end happiness because again as I said even if we reach the pinnacle of happiness death will still end that that path and we'll be left with whatever's in the grave that's the beauty of this dean it makes things so clear it makes things so clear like you don't have to be confused about and with the way in which the world works alas panatala make us amongst those who become servants of his dean may make us amongst those who are able to fill ourselves with his love and his remembrance and may make us amongst those who are able to spread it to those around us while khirat al-wana and in hamd al-ahir al-baladamin
