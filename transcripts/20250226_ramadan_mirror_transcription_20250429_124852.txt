 الحمد لله وكفاء والسلام والعلاق باره الذي نصفة أما بعد فأوذ بالله من الشيطان الرجيم بسم الله الرحمن الرحيم والذين جاهدوا فينا لناه دي أنهم سبولنا سبحان ربك رب للزة أما يصفون والسلام على المرسمين والحمد لله رب العالمين الله من الصلاع من هنا معينths مهبر لله اللس فرtor God سواء رقمSteiskala واقنفئة والعبخ التالي and of course all of you are aware that this opportunity is the upcoming month of Ramadan لmezن Everywhere we obtain a opportunity that presents itself أعتقد أنه مجدداً لنا أن أتفعنا أن أتفعنا just how grand any opportunity is but in particular this opportunity. The prophesy is on a really encapsulated the entire discussion by mentioning that when the month of Ramallah comes the gates of Jannah are opened, the gates of Jannahannah are closed, and the Shayyatine are chained. Honestly, if you pause for a second and just think about that, it is such a big blessing. Because sure life is very complicated, we go through lots of ups and downs, we have different goals that we set for ourselves, we have some successes, we have some failures, but in the end, you and I both know that the complex calculus of life simplifies into one simple binary output or a binary result, which is Jannah and Jannah. In the end, all that really matters is that we get to Jannah, and in the end, all that really matters is that we avoid Jannah. And that's the entire game. Now, I understand that we live in a complex world, and in this complex world we get distracted by so many things that seemingly appear to be important. The wealth that we hold, it appears to be important, the clothes that we wear, it appears to be important, the way we look, it appears to be important, etc., etc. But again, you and I know, at least we know academically in our minds, although we may not necessarily express that through our actions, but at least we affirm with our minds that none of that matters, the only thing that matters is to get to Jannah and to avoid Jannah. And Rammaldon creates that exact opportunity. This is the opportunity, this is the chance of a lifetime that's about to come to us, because that Jannah that we've been knocking whose door we have been knocking upon so consistently, its doors are going to be flung wide open, and the opportunity for all of us to run in that direction is going to be present. And that Jannah that we would do anything in the world to avoid even getting near it, but alone having to approach it, its doors will be closed. And the one, one of the major factors that precludes us from being able to run towards Jannah and to be able to avoid Jannah, namely the Shia Al-Teen, all of them will be chained. So look, there's this opportunity that's before us, and it's really important for us to just pause for a minute, because it's a transition, right? We're about to transition into something really major that is going to have great, great effects on our success and failure, both in this life and the next. So like in any transition, you know, you're making a long journey and all of a sudden you have an option to like go on this highway or go on that highway, you slow down. And when you do, when you slow down, you think, do I need to go here? Do I need to go there? And you not only think about that, but you think about where am I headed, and does this make sense? The direction that I'm going, and does this backwards from my destination, or is this running towards my destination? So it's the same attitude that a believer should have on such opportunities of rise. Now, a few things to appreciate regarding this opportunity. The first is to just appreciate the opportunity itself, which we've touched on very briefly. Honestly, we could talk about this for a full hour. We don't have an hour, but we could talk about this for a full hour. Once you appreciate the opportunity and how valuable it is, we need to just recognize that this is a unique opportunity and the sign of this opportunity is in the arising of the opportunity itself. What do I mean by that? It's a bit vague. So let me just clarify. See, most great opportunities, so this is a great opportunity. Correct? Gates of Jannah are open. Gates of Jannah are closed. The Shiaatine are chained. All of the great benefits of Ramadan, which all of us are aware of, it's an amazing opportunity. Sure, it's a once in a lifetime opportunity, but it happens to, we couldn't say once in a lifetime because it continuously arises in our lifetime, but that also is a mercy of Allah. The point is that it's a very unique opportunity. It's worthy of us pausing and reflecting on. But as opposed to so many great opportunities that arise in life, this opportunity is not contingent upon us, rather it is a complete expression of Allah's mercy and from the very get-go that becomes apparent. Now, how is that from the very get-go that becomes apparent? Because look, any other grand opportunity where we to describe it, there would be some piece of our effort that would allow us to participate in that opportunity. For example, let's take one domain, let's take a football. Okay? Let's say that you're into football, whether you're a fan or whether you're a player, we can put that aside for a second. In the end, fans, players, supporters, they all want one thing. They want that their team go to the Super Bowl. But the Super Bowl, you don't just receive an invitation to the Super Bowl. It doesn't just show up. You have to make all this effort. And even after making the greatest effort that you could ever do, not individually, even as a collective team, even as a collective fan-based, even as a collective city, you still probably won't get to the Super Bowl. It's not very common and many, many, many great players have never even reached the Super Bowl. Forget about even being able to get into a chance to get to the NFL. We're talking about NFL, then Super Bowl. It's just unheard of. It's very rare. And even if they get there, they have to make all the effort in the world, and then they may or may not get there. And that's the case in every opportunity. Look, the Nobel Prize. The Nobel Prize is a great opportunity. It's an expression of a crowning of a scientist for all of the great work that they've done. It's an appreciation of the, to get a monetary prize. They get all these accolades. They get a pat on the back. For all of the work that they've done. But do you know how many great scientists that are out there that never even get a chance with the Nobel Prize? They only give one a year. And even if they give one a year, sometimes they don't appreciate all the other great scientists in the work that they've done. And many, many great scientists get overlooked annually because they can only give limited number of prizes. But so much effort is made. So much effort is made. Lifetime of commitment, lifetime of work, and then you may or may not get the Nobel Prize. Yet in this example of Allah's Panawat al-Alawz-Mirseek, one of the unique aspects of it is, again, even before it begins, is to just appreciate that it's totally independent of our effort. Why? Because we don't have to earn Ramadan. Ramadan comes to us. You don't have to submit a resume for Ramadan to show up. You don't have to have this list of deeds that you performed in order to be amongst those who benefit from Ramadan. You don't have to be at a certain level, or at a certain stage, or have been in the dean for years and years and years before the Ramadan will reveal its blessings to you. No, Subhanallah. Ramadan comes to us. We don't even have to approach it. Literally, Ramadan comes upon us. And Allah's Panawat al-Alawz-Mirseek, who's in control of every single aspect of the universe, rotates the universe in such a way that the sun rises and sets and rises and sets until the month of Ramadan comes, and when it comes, it's delivered to all of us. We don't have to do anything to attain it. No. 1. Number 2. It provides an equal opportunity for every single person. Literally, the greatest sinner has an opportunity of Ramadan. In fact, even, it's very strange, even the greatest sinner, their opportunity is such that it even makes the most pious jealous. Because that person could actually earn Allah's forgiveness and attain great heights in Ramadan that maybe the pious wouldn't be able to experience because they didn't come from that depth of darkness into light. That's the opportunity. It doesn't matter where anyone is. Every single one of us has the opportunity to benefit from Ramadan and Ramadan doesn't differentiate us. It doesn't say this one's wealthy and this one's poor. It doesn't say this one's been in the Dean for five years and this one came five minutes ago. It doesn't say that this person is this ACT or that person is that ACT. No. Because those aren't the things that matter. Those aren't the things that matter in the Dean. The things that matter in the Dean is the intention and the sincerity of each individual and every person has the potential to be able to take advantage of Allah's mercy. And so it is the most equitable opportunity. Let's panel like you look at the world. You're trying to create equitable opportunities, correct? They don't want to bias against race, ethnicity, this, that they're trying to create equality. You're not going to find a more equitable opportunity than you're going to find in the month of Ramadan. The Dean is a whole but Ramadan is simply a manifestation of that. Subhanallah, any one of us, wherever we are, we don't have to worry about whether we're going to benefit in Ramadan. And to guarantee that if we face Allah's panawat ala with sincerity and appreciate where we are and where we want to be, that opportunity is available for us. Where are you going to find such a unique gift and blessing? It's only because of the mercy of Allah's panawat ala that we are able to, number one, Ramadan comes upon us. We don't have to do anything to earn it. And number two, Ramadan creates an equal opportunity for every person that wants to submit itself to it. So where does that leave us? It leaves us with a few important things. Number one, we have to recognize the opportunity. It is unacceptable that we don't stand before Ramadan and see the amazing bounty that Ramadan is going to potentially provide for us. We have to stand here and like stop for a second and pause and say, wow, this opportunity is coming to me. I didn't have to do anything to earn it. I need to recognize what a great mercy this is. And I need to appreciate what a manifestation of Allah's mercy is going to come upon me. What a great manifestation of Allah's mercy that will fall upon me. That's one important aspect of Ramadan. And the second is to say, how am I going to leverage this opportunity? How am I going to take advantage of it? You know, in life when opportunities present themselves, we blame people for their failures in the face of those opportunities. I'm not going to tap some kid on the shoulder in the hallway and say, why didn't you win the Super Bowl? They're not qualified to win the Super Bowl. They didn't have the opportunity. But I'm going to blame my team if they got all the way there and they messed something up because they were there. The opportunity was before them. They could have availed it. So that's the same responsibility that falls upon us. If there's no, in fact, you can think of it this way. If there's no effort on our part that's required for Ramadan to come to us, then I would argue that that is actually the case so that we can take all our effort and turn it to asking the question, how are we going to benefit from Ramadan? Imagine if you had to spend one month fasting before Ramadan would come upon you and only the people who spent a month fasting would be able to avail themselves of Ramadan. Then you would say to me, well, I'm tired. I spent a whole month, I'm burnt out. What do you mean now I got to think about how to take advantage of Ramadan? But 100% of the effort is taken away from us, such that Ramadan comes upon us, which means that 100% of our energy and effort can be leveraged to taking advantage of the month. So again, we have to appreciate the opportunity. And two, because it's an opportunity, we have to plan in our minds where we are and how we're going to take maximum benefit from it. Because like I said, every one of us enters Ramadan in our own states. We're where we are, right? We have done so many things over the year. We only know what sins we've committed. We only know what mistakes are in our closet. We only know what good we've done. And each of us has to face Ramadan and ask ourselves, where are we and where should we be? Why do we ask, where are we? Because we need to be truthful and honest with ourselves about where we stand before our Lord. Because the gates of Jannah are about to be opened in a very unique way. The gates of Jannah are about to be sealed in a very, very merciful way. The Cheyoutines are about to be chained. This is the opportunity that faces us. So we have to be real with ourselves. We can't live in this bubble that we create, which comforts us. It makes us feel better because we surround ourselves with the things that we're most familiar with. So we don't have to ask the hardest questions. No. Ramadan is a mirror. It's a mirror of opportunity. And anytime a mirror of opportunities before us, we have to look in the mirror and ask who am I? As a player, have I prepared myself properly? So we look in the mirror of Ramadan when it begins to rise before us? And we begin to ask ourselves, let me look in the mirror and ask who am I? What have I been doing for the last 11 months? Where have I spent my time? What have I been partaking of and what have I been fasting from? This is the hard question to ask. Because what we do is we as human beings have a habit and a tendency to surround ourselves with the familiar, so we don't have to ask the hard questions. It's tough to ask hard questions of ourselves. It's tough to ask where have I spent my money over the last year. It's tough to ask where did I spend my youth over the last year. It's tough to ask where did I put my time and energy over the last year. It's tough to ask what was my behavior over the last year. And the way that we cover that difficulty and alleviate ourselves from having to face it is to surround ourselves with things that comfort us. But here is an opportunity to step away and be alone for a little bit. Take a few minutes outside of our days, before the month of Ramadan arises, and face Ramadan in its mirror to see our own reflection. What did I do over the past 11 months? Not because we're trying to create circumstance in which we have to look down and ashamed. Sure, there are things we should be ashamed of and we should seek forgiveness for them. But rather, that's the only way that we can actually ascertain how we should take advantage of the opportunity and we can't take full advantage of it until we know where we've been. So this is one important aspect of the month, which is that it's a mirror. We should look at it as a mirror and appreciate where we are and where we should be. So one aspect where we are, the second where we should be. All of us have aspirations and we should have very lofty aspirations. And SubhanAllah, they should be concordant with the deen. The deen, the beauty of the deen, is that it gives us goals for which we should aspire. I don't need you to give me a list of five things that I want to become. I already have those five, ten things on my list from the Sunnah and the Quran. So that's the beauty of the deen. It creates the punch list that we're aspiring towards. And in this upcoming, before we even begin the month of Ramadan, we should ask the question, who do I want to be? Again, looking in the mirror, you look in the mirror and you say, I look this way, but I really want to look that way, correct? When you look in any mirror, you look at your reflection, you say, I look this way, but I actually want my hair to be that way. My clothes look this way, but I actually want them to be that way. My shoes don't match my outfit. I really need to switch them out because they should look this way. Isn't that what anybody does when they look in a mirror? Ramadan's a mirror as well. We look in the mirror and say, I look this way. I actually should look that way. And I'm talking here metaphysically, not physically, obviously. So we should ask the question, what do we want to look like? Meaning, who do we want to be? Who are we aspiring to become? And we should then ask one simple question. After all of that work, one simple question, what am I going to swap to fix the picture? And I'm not asking you to make some long, extensive list because the reality is that if you make a long, extensive list, it just often doesn't happen. I'm just saying, pick one thing. What is the one thing that looks wrong in this picture? When I look at myself in the mirror of Ramadan, what's the one thing about myself that I don't like? Do I need to change this or that? Do I need to adjust C or D? And everyone in this room is going to have a different answer because everyone is a different person. I can't give you a lecture on what that list should be. Because the Dean creates that list, but it has to come from inside. It has to come from within us. Maybe I look at myself in the mirror and I say, you know, my prayers aren't how they should be. Look at how they were. This is how I want them to be. I'm missing a prayer here. I'm missing a prayer there on occasion. So make that adjustment. Make that the singular goal in the month of Ramadan. That's, you know, again, when you look at a mirror, it's not plastic surgery. It's not a minor adjustments, but those minor adjustments make a big difference. So we're looking in the mirror of Ramadan and we need to be realistic about how much we can actually achieve. That the month is miraculous by making a step, many, many, many things will change. But we should simply pick one or two things that we deem to be important for us personally and make that adjustment. Again, like I said, for some of us it might be that there's five prayers in a day and I'm not consistent with them. هل تدخلت جداً؟ لأن I'm going to make this slide adjustment and bring these prayers into my life.If that's the singular or goal that a person has that's acceptable. Maybe it's, I should be in the mustard more often. Maybe the Quran sits on my shelf far more than it sits in my hand. The Quran sits in the shelf but far more than it sits in my hand.iiii jesteśmy زوجي Rig Multạnhي丸سي لهم Нجائد 가지고 مغ doubled نظر المح� salon عدد ك بسلاورieg لكن أنك يريد, أني ستجمع أنassis يا ايض ما يلدى شكل هكذا مرحباً منيmeye انت اقطع اج publication هります but look at my credit card Bill it's just my food MY clothing MY Bishop MY sign I don't find the service of others Frankfurter IN MY So we've been making adjustments We recognise this wealth América informs us that it comes from a lot and this wealth is a test It's been given to us to see how we play the game everything is a game this is a big monopoly game We know that لذلك تريد أن عمله in the way I spent my wealth لأ goes to my life before I became peine مائلة تعارب ميدية وبعجkh إليbars فول kicking الكثيرة حيث مرتفية ويدطب على تلك أذكر من المطأني وبعجاً شيخ عض معني ومن�도 سن evergo و -, حواتي أنتم أتواب فيتداب ولكن ماين تبعون ذلك offician لي لقد ليقل وداحب كل شيء لا يجب أن applekWoman تم أشيحت إلى أم Andrel ل because the dean doesn't judge us based on what we do, it judges us based on the progress that we make Sure! there are some basal things that have to be present you need these five prayers you need fasting in the month of Ramadan You need to go for Hajj, you need to pay Zekeh these are very entry-level simple things that homelessness can achieve that all human beings can achieve But the dean then judges us based on what we aspire towards and the minor adjustments that we make every day when we look in the mirror خ密 أننا Ahora ن enlarتгля millet حسناةه نقليه من آ checklist تادرات الأ Stackر فأناsocial well جد занز выглядد الجئ ر placesي توقف صدورات لبن point لك تزойلا مع الخ Technologies أرغب تو ننزد أمر as well بلا only leap pesticides you might say wait a minute we're talking about the whole dean is appreciation of ala... yes it is the is a mechanism by which we arrive at a destination which is the appreciation of ala but subscriber Ramadan delivers us to that very quickly because of the power of fasting you know that in this in our dean as all of you are aware the deeds are rewarded anywhere from temples to 700 times حسنا. نعم. المنممي روض for any deed is 10 times its value. you do a good deed x. at the minimum it gets multiplied by 10 and written in your account. and it can go up, up to 700. many many examples of so many ways by which great rewards can be earned. but subhanallah the old amaz say that there is one deed for which a multiplier cannot be applied in this life. these are multipliers that we apply in this life for us to be able to understand the power of any given deed and the power of particularly sometimes of a time. for example sometimes time is a multiplier, sometimes the deed is a multiplier. but the old amaz say that in the case of fasting there is no multiplier. not that it doesn't exist but it's such a multiplier that none of us can appreciate it because Allah's pana wa ta'ala has created fasting in such a way that he will reward it on the day of judgment in a way that none of us can fathom. none of us can fathom. we know this from Hedith, we know this from the explanations of our scholars. the deeds have multipliers but fasting is unique because it is for Allah and Allah will reward it in his own unique way. how is it for Allah as opposed to any other deed because it's a hidden deed that no one else can appreciate. no one else can see. look if you don't want a fast-rumble done, you can walk around and pretend like you're fasting. none of us are going to be able to tell. you can take a sip of coffee in your house and no one will know. you can go ahead and eat a meal in the middle of the day and no one will know. it's a personal matter between you and Allah. there's no it's different than saliva. if you're in the muster they see it's different than Zaka when you give Zaka the community knows the receivers know for sure. it's different than how you go for how we all see that you're there. but fasting is unique. no one really knows who's fasting. no one really knows. so panala because of the unique nature of fasting and that it really requires you to appreciate that Allah's panala alone is watching and you're doing it purely for his sake. there is no known multiplier rather that multiplier is present yet it's unknown. it is Allah's panala says this is for me and I shall reward it. and the multiplier remains unknown. so why is this a unique opportunity because it's the opportunity where we can earn Allah's panala himself. his pleasure. you know that on the day of judgment when all the dust is settled. all the dust is settled and everybody is in their abode. the people of jannah are in jannah. then the people in jannah will be addressed and it will be said to them. is there anything more that you desire? they will say what more is there? what do you mean? what more is there? we've already been given everything. we're in jannah. we're experiencing every single wish of ours is being fulfilled. we're experiencing every single desire. and then it will be explained but there's one more thing. there's one more layer. one more layer. what's that one more layer? that one more layer is that Allah's panala will reveal himself just as a full moon is revealed in the sky of this world. and when Allah's panala reveals himself in that way, people will forget about every blessing they've been given and realize that this was the actual reward of jannah. to be able to engage Allah in whichever way He deems us to engage Him. this is the opportunity of Ramadan. to earn Allah's pleasure in such a way that we can't even begin to fathom what that reward would be. so we should leverage it. we should leverage it by appreciating that it's a mirror. it's an opportunity for us to stand before the month and ask the question, how do I look? unfortunately probably very disheveled. but how do I look? and am I happy with that picture? am I happy with what I'm seeing in the mirror? and most importantly, what am I going to change? I'm going to change my outfit, I'm going to adjust my hair, I'm going to change my shoes, I'm going to press myself, meaning press my clothes, press myself, press myself, whatever it might be, we have to make those adjustments. and subhanAllah, if we just make a tiny few adjustments in this month, even before the month arises, but particularly as the month enters, then subhanAllah we will be able to taste some ecstasy. that the tongue has never tasted, that the eyes have never seen, that the ears have never heard, and that will just be the beginning of something far greater, which will be to ultimately experience inshaAllah, Allah's panellah, as he deems us worthy to experience it. subhanAllah, this is a great month that Allah's panellah has bestowed upon us. honestly, if we could just experience one day of it in our entire existence, it would be sufficient. but no Allah's panellah doesn't give us one day, he gives us 30. and if we could experience one such month in our entire lifetime, it would be sufficient. but no Allah's panellah doesn't give us one such experience, he gives us one experience yearly. there's no excuse. we have all the opportunity in the world to take advantage. we have all the excuses in the world to take advantage of this opportunity, and we should really spend a few minutes. I understand Ramadan comes, and then when Ramadan comes we get excited, but I'm asking you to actually do a little homework before Ramadan starts. to spend a few moments, whatever time you feel necessary, to just reflect. on where am I? what do I want to be? how have I spent my last 11 months? what are the things that I want to change? what adjustments am I going to make in Ramadan? and the benefit of that is, like I said, the power of Ramadan is such that I think all of us can appreciate that habits established in Ramadan tend to stick, particularly when they're made at the beginning of the month. so this is a nice, nice chance. people come often saying, how can I change my life? how can I change my circumstance? how can I better myself? and I say, oh, I wish it was Ramadan. because if Ramadan was coming, we could fix a lot of things very quickly. it's a pahnAllah, we don't have to wish it's here. literally, it's just about to arise upon us. so, I'm glad that there's just a few days before it's going to be before us. we know that the prophesies and the we used to remind the companions about the greatness of the month of Ramadan. fortunately, we don't have the ability to do justice to that. again, my words are limited, but we can always read about the statements of the prophesies and I'm concerning this. but I think the greater reminder here is to just appreciate the month in general. the opportunity of the month and our need for that opportunity, the month as a mirror, and our opportunity to make adjustments that inshallah will be lasting outside of the month and will provide us with great benefits in both this life and the next. may Allah's pahnAllah deliver Ramadan to us just as He's delivered it to us so many times before. may Allah's pahnAllah overlook our shortcomings, allow us to be able to truly see ourselves for who we are. may He make us amongst those who are able to appreciate those deficiencies within us that need to be changed. may He make us amongst those who have the tofik and the strength and the wisdom to be able to make any adjustment such that it pleases Him and creates the door for the next opportunity to make additional adjustments. wa a'ahurat alana anin hamd alinahir wa bi-dhalamin
