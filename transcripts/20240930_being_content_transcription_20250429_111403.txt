تongs biz이라고 خلوقت و these three blessings are number one the blessing of cognizance of Allah's panawattah Allah is our Lord number two cognizance that he has blessed us with isnam which is the path to our Lord and number three the blessing of having the prophet Muhammad ﷺ as our messenger and as our prophet so more specifically and the du'a is as follows I've spoken about this here before and it's also in our ربكرة ربيتو بالله ربا I am pleased with Allah as my Lord وابل إسلام دينة and with isnam as my deen what we Muhammad ﷺ صلى الله عليه وسلم نبيية and with Muhammad ﷺ as my messenger نظر في هذا المرحب ونجل three things نمو one the fact that we have cognizance of it as Allah is our Lord and that's a big deal because you walk around the world today and nobody appreciates or the vast majority of people don't appreciate who has created everything around them and who has provided for them and who controls everything around them right this is Allah our Lord and we have been given that cognizance that is a huge blessing and the second is that we're acknowledging and stating and appreciating that the blessing of isnam is our deen now everybody has a way of life they may not know it but everybody follows something and Subhanallah we're not just arbitrarily following our own ideas but rather we're following isnam which is a path which leads us to our Lord what is isnam essentially what's the summary of isnam what are the things that I can do to earn Allah's pleasure what are the things that I need to avoid to to spare myself from Allah's displeasure and how can I be successful in this life of the next this is essentially isnam and we have this path like you don't wake up in the morning scratching your head wondering what you need to do if you are confused about something you don't need to go to the bookstore and like have a conference to figure out like how am I supposed to live my life the broad tenance of how we live life are already established for us this is such a big blessing we don't have to come up with the recipe we just have to follow it put it that way the recipe is given to us we just have to follow it so this is a second huge blessing and the third is that we have the prophet Muhammad al-Azza wa-Mas'ar messenger meaning he's the guide along that path of isnam so not only do we have a destination which is the pleasure of Allah not only do we have a path that leads to that destination which is isnam but we have a guide and we have such a guide that he would pick us up himself and carry us to the destination he wants that we reach the destination more than he himself would reach the destination that's his desire now he's at the destination obviously so I send him but he wants that much that we reach that destination and not just you and I all of all of humanity that was his desire so these three blessings are immense and when we recite this to Allah in the morning and the evening we've been told in narrations in multiple different narrations actually to recite this one narration mentions reciting this three times in the morning and three times in the evening and it's particularly mentioned there that the individual who recites this three times in the morning and three times in the evening Allah's panawat al-Azza wa-Mas'ala will please them on the day of judgment now notice the recie... notice how this is a like a reciprocal relationship in the sense that we appreciate these key blessings that Allah has bestowed upon us and when we appreciate these key blessings that Allah's panawat al-Azza wa-Mas'ala has bestowed upon us and show our true get gratitude then in exchange Allah's panawat al-Azza wa-Mas'ala will please us meaning I am so happy and pleased with Allah islam and the Prophet's al-Azza wa-Mas'ala by expressing that from the depth of my heart Allah's panawat al-Azza wa-Mas'ala will in turn please me on the day of judgment in another narration the Prophet's al-Azza wa-Mas'ala mentioned that the individual who recites this Janda becomes glad you for them mandatory for them and in another narration again it's a little weak but it's accepted by the scholars the Prophet's al-Azza wa-Mas'ala mentions that the person who recites this he will take them by their hand to Janda why because if we're pleased with the Prophet's al-Azza wa-Mas'ala our guide then he is going to please us as our guide by delivering us to our final destination which is Janda this is a really powerful statement it's so short and sweet but it has so much power packed within it come on how much time does it take think about it for a second to recite this three times in the morning and three times in the evening that's that you want to recite it three times in the evening now I don't think it makes it thirty seconds for the people of the world of Islam the people of the Prophet's al-Azza wa-Mas'ala will be Muhammad the Prophet ten seconds times three thirty it's actually no effort but it has such a reward but what's important to appreciate here is that it's not merely the words that are rewarded there's an underlying premise that creates power in these words what's the underlying premise that from the depth of my heart I look at these three blessings and I say to myself I don't need anything else I'm absolutely happy I'll give you an example imagine I don't know imagine that you had the three flashiest cars the three best cars you have I don't know what they are Ferrari Lamborghini and something make up any example you want whatever you guys like okay you open your garage in the morning and you just look there and you just smile and say I'm done what else do I need like I got not one car I got three or imagine if you're into jewelry you've got like three diamonds on your finger they're like ten carrots each I don't know if they make ten carrots each when you what are you going to do first thing in the morning when you wake up you're just going to like wake up and do this right you're going to look at those diamonds and you're going to be like one two three I'm done like doesn't matter what else happens in the rest of the day you can't give me anything more I've got what I want I'm already full you know like you go to a dinner and somebody gives you really good food you eat your fault they try to put another spoon and you're like no no no no no I'm good I don't need anymore this was good and I'm good that's the attitude of the Muslim they wake up in the morning they look at their three rings on their finger and they're like wow I am set that's the attitude of the believer and Imam Noah we him makes an interesting statement concerning this doah he says that what does it mean to be pleased because this is I am pleased with Allah as my Lord I am pleased with Islam as my Dean I am pleased with Muhammad so I sell him as my messenger so Imam Noah we in his commentary says what does it mean to be pleased he he says it means that I'm so contented that I want nothing more like I'm so full because you gave me everything I can't take another spoon now that attitude to start the morning and to start the evening with that attitude the consequence of that completely changes the way that you view the world and the way that you interact with it because what would there what would there be what what could occur to make a person sad if they've already got everything that they need and what would there be that could make a person happy if they already got what they need but the problem is instead of looking at the three rings in our finger we're looking at everything around the world and we're letting the the oscillations of life push us around we're getting happy if we get a little trinket here and we're getting sad if a little trinket gets deleted here but those are nothing compared to the wealth that we have you know it'd be like a billionaire crying if that somebody took a cent from them it's like imagine just imagine for a second there's a billionaire you go into his house he's picking up all the pillows from his couch say amen what are you doing like why are you taking all the pillows I can't find my penny you'll be scratching your head like what you can't find your penny you you have like three diamonds on your fingers that are each worth like a billion dollars you're looking for a penny or it'd be like a billionaire you know getting super ecstatic if they got a penny you'd be like what what is a penny you already got everything you need this life is a bunch of pennies there's nothing of value in this world the only thing of value in this world is to achieve a lot and his pleasure which Islam brings you to and the prophesy Islam delivers you to so what is this ups and downs I understand it's human nature to have ups and downs I'm not denying that but what is this fixation on I didn't get this I didn't get that or I got this and I got that and nobody in this room everybody in this room knows that those things never satiate you anyway just as a simple example I'll just tell you just let's just be very clear I could I would be willing to argue come make a very strong argument that every person in this room every person in this room is living better than the kings 100 or 200 let's make it 200 years ago 200 years ago the king did not have air air conditioning did not have heating did not have cooling did not have running water did not have instant communication could not have fruits outside of their season did not have refrigeration did not have storage did not have like 15 orange juices that you can choose from in the grocery store did not have like aisles and aisles and aisles of food from all over the world anytime they desire could not press a button and have food delivered to their door whenever they thought of a type of food that none of the kings in the world experienced that but if you would have asked the people in the world what could I be I wish I could be this king I would live such a perfect life we have everything that a king did not have 200 years ago we live better lives we have health we have longer lives we don't have to fear all the diseases that are out there we have all these different technologies that have had quote unquote advanced us yet we experienced the same symptoms that they did what is that symptom that symptom is not appreciating the blessings that we have and instead wanting more and that's the type of disease to not look at the blessings that we have and to desire something beyond all of the world that's been given to us now by the way this is the primordial fallacy why is this the primordial fallacy because think about it for a second when our grand our spiritual grandparents howa and adama rehim isanam were in jannah you understand that we weren't here this is not home we've just been delivered here as some sort of like tests it's like a musibah it's a headache this place is a headache it's not home we're waiting to go home home is jannah we've been like expelled from home temporarily as a test our grandparents were in jannah they were in their home and what was what was their circumstance while they were there they were told that they could partake of all of jannah meaning they had the availability of all of jannah to them and what happened sorry they had the availability of all of jannah with one exception the pro a law of panoat al-Ahmad mentioned to them do not partake of this tree in fact more specifically do not go near this tree because you will wrong yourselves okay nothing about it for second every single blessing of jannah is absolutely available what more could be desired except this one little tree that's like relatively speaking little that is prehibited but what happens shethan recognizes that this inherent weakness in human beings and says oh you know that tree this in the crown you can look at the story you know that tree that tree gives angelic characteristics or makes you live forever now what happens instead of focusing on the wide swath of all of the jannah human nature through the whispering of shethan takes attention to the one thing i don't have and so because shethan was able to leverage the one thing i don't have now we're stuck with this headache of being tested in this world and having to survive the test in order to achieve success in the hair after because that led to the expulsion from jannah this disease is the same disease that all human beings have the potential to suffer from and i'd argue that we actually are suffering from it constantly we've been given so much but we have this habit of looking at all the things that other people have and wondering why we don't have that when we actually don't even need it and this dhua is actually reminding us of the true wealth that Allah has blessed us with first of all from a material perspective one of the very important principles of our dean is that we do he job from the dunya we don't look at what other people have and wish that we have that we look at what we've been given and we're grateful for that and already argued on a material perspective we're already ahead of the kings of 200 years ago and that was just materially i'm not even talking about spiritually we're just talking about materially materially every single one of us is far ahead of even the kings of 200 years ago so what's more there what's there more to be desired but no the world has to advertise to us people have to advertise to us advertise there's a convincing us to buy a bunch of things that we don't need people are convincing us that they have something sparkly and shiny and that we too should be having that you're competing against the jones as they say so this is a first point or first responsibility for all of us to appreciate the blessings that Allah has given us we should fully appreciate and we should be completely drowned in gratitude to Allah for the material blessings that we've been given the health the wealth the time the ability etc but then we have to go another level beyond as muslims and we have to appreciate that even though we've been given such material blessings we have to then recognize that they're actually not worth anything because the material world is passing and has no reality to it what only the only thing that matters is to appreciate Allah as our Lord to have Islam as our way and to follow the message and the guidance of the prophets all I send them and so when that gets put into perspective then the material stuff that we've been given completely gets pushed to the side and instead we begin to realize that hey no matter what I have materially it doesn't even matter because I am so content I'm so full I'm so happy with these three blessings that the world could disappear it doesn't matter to me that's the message that we're trying to express when we make this do up does not a part of a bunch of words you know I just read this every morning islam dina will be Muhammad nabiya next next next I read it three times next no do aah is an expression from the heart the prophet i said i mentioned a do aah mochul aibada do aah is the core of ibadah what does that mean it's the core of ibadah what is ibadah ibadah is the expression of the reality of our existence that this is Allah my creator this is who i am in need and completely dependent upon his blessings i'm asking for him i'm asking from him for something because I know that no one else in the world can provide it that chasm has to exist in order for true doa to be present and that's what it means when it said doa is the core of ibadah because ibadah is essentially worship meaning we're raising a lot and lowering ourselves so the when we make a doa for example like we just spoke about in the beginning radi to bin lahir abba wo bin islam dina wo bin Muhammad nabiya this is not just some words that we're speaking because we memorize them or we read them from a page these are coming from the heart so that means that in my heart i'm literally looking at these three diamond rings on my finger spiritual metaphysical diamond rings and i'm saying i have the cognizance of Allah i have islam to deliver me to Allah's pleasure and i have the provisionalism who's picking me up by my hand and taking me to my destination so what do i need what do i need materially i've already been made a king or a queen so that let's just throw that away for a second just on a rational argument level and now metaphysically i've got the only three things that matter i am a trillionaire and what law trillionaire is at under expression it's an under exaggeration you trillionaire does not even does not even i don't have a word in English to capture the wealth of these three diamonds on our fingers there's no word to capture this because it's the essence of everything it's all that matters on the day of judgment and the grave and in fact isn't that what the test is going to be in the grave the first thing that's going to happen when we get to the grave after a quick triage we're going to be asked three questions what are those three questions who is your lord what is your dean who is your messenger these three questions are the questions that define what happens to us downstream of the grave and these three answers are given in this exact statement but where does that statement come from it comes from the heart on the day when we're in the grave we're not going to be reciting some supplications from a book like who is my messenger wait let me look that one up i used to recite this thing no that's the part the hard part of the test is that what's in the heart is going to be exposed you know like on the day of judgment what's going to be exposed that our hearts are going to be squeezed as if the glass has been eaten them and the sins are going to come out and the goodness is going to come out the truth of who we are is actually going to be exposed the grave is the beginning of that when these three questions are asked it's not a memory question it's not do I remember the answers that I was you know trained to give it's did my what is my heart say is my heart full of looking at what the rest of the world has and never being happy with what's in my closet never being happy what's in what's in my pantry always wanting more than what's in my garage what is that that that's just a deception we have been given the three most valuable things in existence imagine for a moment where would we be if we didn't know our destination was the pleasure of Allah what would we be pursuing imagine that even if we knew the destination was Allah well we didn't have the path to get to the destination we would be holding conferences scratching our head trying to come up with what is Islam and imagine if we didn't have a guide who actually loves us and wants us to succeed more than he would have wanted himself for himself loves us like his children you know like a parent wants more for themselves than they more for their children than they want for themselves the process of them is like our spiritual parent literally desiring to pick us up and deliver us to the destination these are such gems that we have to learn to express of we have to learn to appreciate them and express them from our heart and this is what Imam Nehwai is saying in his commentary he's saying to be pleased with Allah Islam and the Prophet Muhammad so I said them is to be so satiated that I don't want anything more you give me a million dollars or you take from me a million dollars it doesn't change me you know like they say that the scholars of the past the Messiah of the past like you'd put something really really valuable in front of them and they would get it they wouldn't smile you would take something from them away from them they wouldn't fall because these things were nothing they were immaterial to them although they're material they were immaterial to them what they had was far more valuable than what they could be given nobody can give me anything more than what I've already been given I got three diamonds on my hands and nobody can take from me anything that that's going to be of any value because I've got three diamonds on my hands this is the attitude understanding of the Muslim and by the way this is what brings the Muslim to ultimate peace because I don't have to worry about the oscillations of the people of the world I'm not caught up I'm not playing in their game I'm not playing in that arena I'm on a whole another level you think like if you go watch like a little league baseball game you're going to like be cheering and crying as if you won the world series no it's like a little league very you can't even compare it's like the little league versus like the world series like I'm like in the Super Bowl and I'm crying about like I lost my game when I was playing flag flag football in fifth grade recess who who does that who does that these three blessings they have that every Muslim wakes up in the morning and has to appreciate these three blessings over everything else and if a person appreciates these three blessings so many of their problems will simply disappear look as life perfect is everybody in our life going to be perfect is my job going to be perfect is my you know income going to be perfect is my espouse going to be perfect is every human being around me going to be perfect and my neighbor is going to be perfect is my house going to be perfect no because this is not a place of perfection to begin with this is not a place of perfection to be begin with it's everything is inherently imperfect in this in this world but what is perfect these three blessings are perfect that's what we should be we should be grateful for and if we see them for what they truly are then so much peace arises in the heart of a believer because they begin to see the rest of the world for for what it truly is which is limited and passing relative to the permanent and lasting blessings of jinnah so this is a dua that we should recite three times a day three times by the way the recommend date and at the recommendation the assignment from the Sunnis to recite this three times in the morning and three times in the evening and we should recite this three times in the morning and three times in the evening but I'm just reminding you that we should recite it holding our hearts and looking at our fingers meaning in this metaphysical this example that I'm giving just establishing an example looking at our fingers and just saying I got these three diamonds what else do I need I'm starting my day this way I'm starting my night this way everything else is in material and that's the truth and that brings tremendous peace it brings tremendous happiness and by the way keeps us focused on the things that really matter because look if I've got three three diamonds on my finger and I appreciate the values of these three diamonds that tell me what am I going to do for the rest of the day I'm going to be guarding these three things I'm going to guard my relationship with Allah I'm going to guard my Islam and I'm going to guard my connection with the prophesy center because these are the three things that make me who I am may Allah's panel and all that make us amongst those who are able to appreciate all of the continuous and immeasurable blessings that he's bestowed upon us may he make us amongst those who are able to appreciate the blessings of Islam and the blessings of appreciating him as our Lord and the blessings of having the prophet so I said them as our guide may Allah's panel always keep us consistent in his liquid and remembrance and may he make us amongst those who make the liquid and remembrance and doah truly from the depth of our hearts well I'll pray to Allah and in the name of Allah I hope you've been
