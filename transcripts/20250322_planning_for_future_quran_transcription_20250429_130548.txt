we're not going to discuss this instead we're going to discuss the second goal the second goal is a little more nuanced it requires a little bit of wisdom but in Shahu Allah it will make sense in the context of our conversation that goal is to not only take advantage of the month أ perhaps I should say it this wayqi الكثيرж هل يtımيد من الرicios يتحدثون على مجرد أن يتطلب رسميين على الرين يم when

allows things to become malleable. for example if you want to bend a piece of metal, they'll heat it up to very high temperatures and then they'll shape it into the mold that they're trying to achieve and then they'll let it cool back down because it's only in the face of that high heat that you can attain that degree of malleability, particularly for something that's so hard as metal. في same way when we spend these days and nights fasting and praying, we achieve a certain degree of spiritual heat. and that spiritual heat, along with purifying us, also provides us with the opportunity to change things about ourselves that perhaps could not be changed at any other time of the year. it's very very hard to change habits. very very hard to change who we are. great that we appreciate in our minds that we want to be someone and that we should be doing certain things and that we should be behaving in certain ways. but it's not easy to change. i mean how many times do we make a decision that i'm going to be a better this or i'm going to be a better that i'm going to be a better servant i'm going to be a better husband i'm going to be a better father whatever it might be we sometimes can appreciate that we need to change but making the changes very very difficult. and so while we're maximizing on this amazing opportunity to gain so much reward in these last 10 days and nights, i think it's also important to maybe sit down and make a list of the things that we want to change and think about how we're going to actually enact that change. because nothing just happens on its own we actually have to make some sort of commitments and then think about how once the month ends we're going to be able to make that adjustment. all right in the context of that let me just take a step back and say that one of the beautiful things about our dean is that when we aim to change we don't have to the target is not nebulous meaning the target is not just some sort of like vague thing about i think i should be this and i think i should be that. so panel one of the great blessings of dean is that when we're aiming for change we have the companions as our model as a role model. like if i want to know who i should be i can look at the companions and i can appreciate features within each of them that inspire me and that are a target for who i should be and the reason that we can do that so confidently is because the caran declares their state. for example, ravi Allahu'anhu'anhu'anhu'an الله is pleased with them and they are pleased with Allah. that's a huge complement coming from the creator of the universe saying that the companions had reached such a state that Allah is pleased with them and that they are also pleased with him. another example you are the best of communities that has ever arisen from mankind. this was an address directly to the companions for what they had achieved in the company of the provostiacenem. so what that means is that that establishes a criterion for excellence for us. we can look at the companions we can appreciate their wonderful characteristics which essentially arose in the face of company of the provostiacenem and we can aim towards those. so that's the model. now how do you make the model? one thing is somebody puts a beautiful model in front of you but doesn't give you any plans to how to make it. you'll be able to appreciate the beauty but you'll never be able to appreciate that you can reproduce it. but the dean goes one step further it actually gives us the it gives us the model by which they were able to achieve this. the dean goes one step further it not only talks about the greatness of the companions but it also gives us the model by which they became great. so that's also very special because it gives us it gives us some insight into how we too can make change in our lives. because essentially what is the story of the companions? the story of the companions is a story of change. i would argue that there's probably no generation that underwent such massive change because where did they start? they started with kufar shirk. they were like you know following one messenger in the office suddenly another messenger came and rectified them. they started at absolute kufar in shirk and they were brought to the highest pinnacle of his name, thohid. essentially the ultimate expression of thohid that is a huge change. that is a massive distance traversed and in a period of relatively years. right? so the ability that the change that occurred with them is a very very important dynamic of the companions that we should appreciate because it also for us creates a mechanism or model by which we can also undergo change. so their change obviously occurred in the company of the profsites on them. and in his company there were essentially three features which we've talked about before but i'm just stating in the context of the time and space that we're in today. we there were there were three features of the profsites on them that were present that essentially encapsulate how they were able to make that change. and that goes all the way back to the description of the profsites on them in dua of ibrahim al-Ahi s-Sana. and he teaches them wisdom or he uses a key him and he purifies them. so these were the three features of the profsites on them's mission that brought the sahaba from one extreme all the way to the other. what were they? number one, engagement with the ayat of the part and this is non-negotiable. it's the first step. i think in this month of Ramadan we've come to appreciate that and each of us while we're engaging look around during this month. we not only should maximize on the opportunity and engage it as much as possible but we should make a plan for how we're going to engage it outside of the month. the one who celebrates ramalang the most spiritually is the one who prepared for 11 months with the qaran beforehand. they're the ones who enjoy the qaran, they're the ones who enjoy the month of ramalang the most because they spent 11 months developing a relationship with it understanding it, learning it, reading it, making it their companion. so when it's going to sparkle and shine which happens still in the month of ramalang then they're going to gain the greatest benefit. so while we take advantage and i'm again i'm not saying that they told you goal number one is to take maximum advantage and i appreciate it i see all of you sitting here with your most huffs and you've all had goals and many of you introduced your goals at the beginning and those are all wonderful but i would just say take it one step further and ask the question how am i going to maximize on my engagement with the qaran in order to be able to take maximum benefit from the year and the next ramalang that's where the wisdom lies. now sif hanAllah if you look at the interaction of the qaran with the companions you can learn some basic principles that are very useful for how we can come up with a paradigm to maximize on this dimension. now there's lots of dimensions we talked about correct we talked about qaran we talked about knowledge we talked about desuqia but right now we're just going to focus on the qaran for a minute and that is that the companions dimension how they used to take the qaran from the prophet's eye sent them. so that's another model for us because they're not just the qaran is saying that send a messenger who will recite the ayat to them but then the sahaba themselves explain how they took the qaran from the prophet's eye sent them and they say for example that we used to take ten ayat at a time we would take ten ayat and we would learn those ten ayat and after we learned those ten ayat we would return back to the prophet's eye sent them and we would then take an additional set of ten ayat. so now this gives us a little hint into how we can maximize our interaction with the qaran. it's not like you have to grab the whole thing and it just capture it in a week rather if we just take a few verses at a time spend the time enjoying them you know for example maybe let's just say that you're in your journey you make you take the first ten verses of the qaran and you're in your journey and you just not you're not comfortable reading them properly so maybe the goal is to develop a connection with someone that will allow you to be able to learn to read those properly and you just every day or make it every week if you want you spend time engaged with these ten verses maybe it's memorization so you just make a goal for yourself that every I don't know week you're going to memorize ten ayat but there's no there's no set time limit that you have to do it in a day but you're just going to do it in small batches maybe it's like I said recitation maybe it's reading maybe it's understanding but it's small pieces in fact in another in another narration the companions mentioned that the angel jibadi al-A<|ar|> salam when he used to come to the prophet says he used to give five ayat at a time five by five five by five five five by five again not necessarily five exactly every time but the point still remains that it was piecemeal it was piecemeal so if we just simply made a intention to engage the qaran it's some sort of cadence and we don't need to get to the end we just need it to be a consistent cadence that journey will result in every ramallan becoming a milestone to progress which will eventually lead to each ramallan being better than the last for example I don't know I don't have a calculator in front of me but you can calculate it there's roughly 600 pages and you know the Medina most huff for example right and I don't know how many other lines are there 15 lines so what is it 600 times 15 and then let's just say you do three lines a day roughly three lines a day three lines a day is not a big deal okay and you say to yourself after every prayer I'm going to re-memorize these three lines so that means you're spending five minutes after every prayer just engaging it those five those three lines so what is that equal I know what you can do it somebody can do the math but what eight ten years something like that within ten years you would have captured the entire Quran and what in whatever intention you had whether that's memorizing reading engaging understanding it would become you would become much close much more closely associated with it than then you are now and honestly time just passes anyway that's time is an escalator it's going to move you in some direction or another either it's going to move us in the wasting of time of following what's going on in the news you know so that ten years later you don't even remember what happened in the last seventy yet nine years like if I you know you know how much time do we spend following the news following a following b following sports whatever it might be we follow all these things but then if you go back and look you say what did I do over the last decade okay I'm 35 what did I do since I was 25 I'm 45 what have I done since I was 35 I can't even say what you did but imagine if you could say that I had this relationship with the Quran over the last five seven eight nine ten years how much that would be a treasure that could actually be something of immense valuable than this life and the next so this is the this is the type of thinking that we should have as we engage with Ramallah and we think about what we're going to do outside of the monk now one more point concerning this by the way it doesn't like I said it doesn't even need to be like I need to do everything in a year goal it could be that I'm just going to do three Jews in a year it could be I'm going to one Jews in a year honestly one Jews in a year thirty years is going to pass anywhere if you're thirty wouldn't you love it to be able to say that by sixty I've achieved this goal in my life it's doable it's very much doable one Jews in a year one Jews in a year is you calculated twenty times if it's fifteen lines you can calculate what that is right and then you can divide that it was become probably less than a line a day a line a day roughly it's not a big deal right so when you start looking at things from the perspective of what Allah's panatullah has given us as an opportunity of time you begin to appreciate that if you actually were to divide it it becomes so much easier so that should be the goal for example maybe the goal is I just memorized the thirty is just by next tremble gone so that I can enjoy that my prayer I can enjoy it when I listen to it I can take the key messages from it it's not a hard goal I don't know everybody will make their own goal my point that I'm trying to make here is that this month is going to end just as quickly as it came and we're going to be left with eleven other months which we're going to have to manage somehow and in that if we don't have a plan we're just going to be blown by the wind as soon as we get out because I've got nothing to anchor me so now I'm blown by whatever season of sports it might be now I'm blown by whatever the news might be going on in the world I'm blown by whatever's trending on tiktok and youtube so that's not what that's not how we make decisions as Muslims we've got goals we have very very we're very directed we're on a very straight path that path guides us in a very very specific way and we want to leverage that opportunity to anchor ourselves to the things that matter in life now the second point regarding the interaction with the Quran along with making some sort of long term goal is to just appreciate that they took the Quran from the prophet's eye sent them any of the sahaba sahaba took the Quran from the prophet's eye sent them so when the sahaba are taking the Quran from the prophet's eye sent them this is also a reminder to us that it's not just the Quran but it's that we also need to create the environment that's conducive to that because what happens is we make goals but goals are never achieved without environments that's just the reality we can have all these lofty goals but you're not going to be able to achieve them until you have an environment that's conducive to that goal and when you get into an environment that's conducive to that goal you'll be able to be way better than you ever imagined and the proofs in the pudding because I took any one of you and pulled you out of the gathering and sent you back home you're not going to do nearly what you were able to do here there's going to be a night and day difference now why are each of us able to achieve what we're doing here here because there's an environment right there's something that you plugged yourself into when you plug yourself into it you can follow the paradigm you just have to go along with the schedule on the schedule is just pushing you along this escalator of time is just going to deliver you at the end of 10 days when you look at your resume of what you achieved in these days it will be far more than you could have achieved on your own so likewise just as we're dependent on any environment likewise we're dependent upon those environments that are most conducive to achieving the goals that we have for the Quran so what does that mean it means that we should seek out teachers and environment and spaces where we can achieve that goal and I say this all the time that we as parents particularly if you're in this room and you're have younger children you're always focused on like hey where are my kids going to engage the Quran are they going to engage the Quran at the local must-do they're they going to engage the Quran with the local teacher are they going to do a hip-flow or here etc etc but what about us we should be asking the question of ourselves we're just as much in mature as they are perhaps sometimes they're advanced and we're not they're more advanced than us so we should be asking the question what about us where am I going to engage the Quran which teachers am I going to spend time with and some how do there's no excuses today because you've got so many opportunities even online now not that online is ideal it's limited because you don't get that full environment but it's an opportunity right it's an opportunity that's available at least when you don't have the physical opportunity at least you can have like a virtual opportunity so all of us should have two intentions well let's say three in the context of the conversation three intentions regarding the Quran as we go through these last 10 days the first is that we just want to re-establish our connection with it and so we should engage it as much as possible during these 10 days we want really want it to be like the primary thing in our lives and to make it the primary things in our lives we have to push everything away hamd al-Allah you're spending time in atikaf everything has automatically been pushed away just by the nature of the gathering so the only thing you have to do is now fill the space hamd al-Allah you can fill the space with Quran so that's obviously goal number one which is to take advantage of the opportunity at hand but goal number two is to make a plan for what's going to happen outside how am I going to engage the Quran once the month ends so maybe I make an intention 20 minutes every day all of you know i've been talking about this you know for 20 years 25 years 20 minutes a day of the Quran is non-negotiable it can't be there's nothing else greater by which there's nothing else greater through which we can approach Allah there is no greater blessing it's the miracle of our deen every messenger came with a miracle we know this from hadeem every messenger came with a miracle and the message that the miracle of the prophet's eye sent him the greatest miracle of the prophet's eye sent him is the Quran it is the it is the living miracle of Islam and what makes it miraculous the scholars mentioned there's many layers to its miraculous nature but one of its one of the one of the features of that miraculous nature is the fact that it changes us it can take us from one extreme which we talked about all the way to the opposite extreme it has that power but it doesn't have that power by it sitting on our shelves it doesn't have that power by us just merely thinking we wish we could do it all those there's there's a reward for the intention mind you it has that power when we have a very clear plan for how we're going to engage it so for example you might say to yourself every day after mullerb i'm going to just pick up this most often spend 20 minutes with it and you could just recite three lines over and over again until you become absolutely familiar with them you could memorize them if you if that's easier you could read them read them read them and then eventually at the very end look at the translation whatever it might be but again there needs to be a plan and the time to make those kind of plans is when you've eliminated everything because you've created a vacuum in your lives right you've seen that hey I can get rid of everything I'm actually a true human being I'm much happier everything is much cleaner everything is much easier that's the beauty of this he'll take off but when you get back you're going to have to put things back in their place and I'd rather that you expunge the garbage and not make a space for it to return and the only way for that to happen is by having a concrete plan for what am I going to do with my time once the month of Ramadan ends and the first thing on the list the first thing on the list vis-à-vis that plan has to be the Quran non-negotiable non-negotiable it has to be the Quran this is how the companions were able to achieve what they achieved and it is the miracle of our deen which is alive and available for us all the way until this day and to leverage to try to leverage anything else to make change when the Quran has been provided for us is just never going to achieve the goal that we set for ourselves may Allah SWT make us amongst those who are able to take advantage of the blessings of the Quran in these final days of Ramadan and may He grant us the wisdom to be able to embed this Quran in our lives outside of the month of Ramadan.
