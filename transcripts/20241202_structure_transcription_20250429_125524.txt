 الحمد لله وكفى والسلام على إباده الذين اصطفى أما بعد فاوض بالله من الشيطان الرجيم بسم الله الرحمن الرحيم والذين جاهدوا فينا لنا حديا انهم سبولنا سبحان ربك رب للزة مه<|sl|> محمد والة أيليسي دينة محمد وبرك وسلم وكل time you want to construct something or build something it's always important to have pillars or some sort of general idea about how you're going to put the pieces together just as an example, I've used this example many times before but if you look around at the machine, there's lots of components that go into putting together the building and I can tell you that the foundational structure of the building is a bunch of pillars and those pillars are essential because they form that underlying backbone of the building it's upon the pillars that other pillars are connected and then eventually the stone is connected on the outside and the walls are connected on the inside and all of these components that we see they're all on that backbone of the pillars and Subhanallah, life is the same way particularly the life of a believer let me take a step back and just say life is the same way every person wakes up in the morning and they have this goal of constructing, let's say for example, a good day or maybe if they think a little more generally of constructing just a good life but they often are missing the foundations upon which they can build that life because if you've got this blank sheet of paper in front of you and you have to create something, it's very hard to know where things should be attached and what should come first and what should come second and what should come last but when you have some sort of paradigm or a model or a paradigm and upon which you can build, it makes it so much easier you can't even begin to fathom the difference it's like trying to make something but not knowing where any of the pieces fall or is having a model and knowing which pieces need to be laid down first maybe even a better example that's more relatable would be like a puzzle let's say that I gave you like a 200, 500 piece puzzle I didn't give you any model upon which to build that puzzle you would have massive difficulty putting it together it would be very difficult because you wouldn't know where things go but if I gave you the edges and then I gave you like a little picture it would be very easy to put the other pieces together and in fact anyone who makes puzzles they usually will start at the edges although start with some recognizable landmark that they can build and then construct the entire image around so there's a big difference between waking up randomly and not knowing how my day should look versus having organization in our days or even more so in our lives and this is one of the great blessings of our Dean this is one of the great blessings of our Dean meaning that every day we wake up we have a paradigm by which we can establish certain things in our life and we have those things upon which we can attach other things in our lives just a very simple example so every day you wake up you know that you have to have five prayers in your day and what we don't appreciate is just how much structure that provides I don't wake up and like randomly think like what's my day going to look like let me try to map out my day let me try to make a schedule should this come first or third should this come last or tomorrow there's five things in my day that are totally set I know I need to be up at Fajr I know that I need to take a break at Vohar I know that I need to take a break at Aasur I know that I'm going to try to end my day by Mugrub and I know I'm going to try to you know, cap off my evening with Aisha and ideally I get into the mustard that is a huge blessing on us I know people sometimes see it as a burden like I got to pray these five prayers but we fail to appreciate what a huge blessing that is upon us because those are like pillars in fact they are termed pillars the prayer is a pillar of our deen correct it is a pillar it allows us to stake down five points in our day and those points become like pillars upon which we can build the rest of our day it's a great blessing and recognizing this number one it allows us to be able to just appreciate how our day can be formed and number two it gives us an anchor to which we can tie down other things for example often people will ask me let's say they have an assignment or they have something that's important to them whatever it might be let's say that you've decided that you want to have like a daily routine of the good or you've decided that you want to engage the Quran regularly or you've decided that you know there's something I want to learn in order to improve myself at work whatever it might be mother it's a dino way or dini it's the point here is irrelevant per second one of the greatest ways to develop consistency is to just attach it to one of the prayers for example if you said to yourself that every day when I come from a group or when I pray a group I'm going to sit for five extra minutes and just open the Quran and read it's going to be way easier than just waking up in the morning and saying I'm going to pray I'm going to read Quran for five minutes today because it's not anchored to any without having it attached to the prayer it's not anchored to anything but when a person says you know I'm just going to make a hard fast rule for myself I know I'm going to pray Muglub but as soon as Muglub is over I'm just going to take five additional minutes and I'm going to maybe recite Quran I'm going to make a little whatever it might be that is going to lead to consistency and it's the consistency that will lead to success so we have to appreciate that our lives are basically they come prebuilt we don't have to wake up you know we don't even have to think about like so many things I've already been laid out for us it doesn't mean that we don't have any flexibility in our day of course we have flexibility in our day but so many things are already laid out for us and in any minute we should ask ourselves the question what was the Sunnah at this time of the day and how can I maximize on that Sunnah in order to be able to leverage the rest of my day for example if you said to yourself you know I need to study for a big test coming up and you're trying to figure out when you can put that into your schedule or how you're going to manage that over the next two three months and we have some very simple principles in our dean for example we know that it's a generally good principle to go to bed early at night you know 10 o'clock let's say a late-ish up by 10 o'clock two in the morning it's not a good time to be studying right we have that principle in our dean so we can we can aim for that I don't have to like page through like a self-help guide and try to figure out what's the best time for me to study I know that once you pray let's say the time of a show a couple hours maybe 10 o'clock roughly that time 10 o'clock is a time when I should be settling down not starting something new and I know that if I go to bed at that time it's good to go to bed early because you get up early and when you get up early it's a good time for a thicker and when you get up early it's a good time to attach something else in the morning that you hope to achieve I've spoken about this before here just as a reminder you know there's this principle that some self-help gurus they like to promote where they say that for the first 90 minutes after you wake up you should just do you should do the most important thing in your day right this this is one of their principles that when you wake up in the morning before you get distracted before you get involved in anything else you should already have a map in your mind of what's the most important thing that I'm trying to achieve over a term let's say over 90 days is what they use over a 90 day period what what is my goal and I'm going to hit that first thing in the morning every day now why do they mention that because they say that when you sleep your mind gets cleared and your most fresh when you wake up and you're you have the most degree of clarity when you clarity when you wake up so if you attach right away to your first beginning of the day for the first 90 minutes whatever is the most important you're going to be highly productive in that without with minimal distractions now this is already a principle from the son of by the way they're just rehashing it with some other with some other like details but we know this is a principle that there's baraka in the mornings and that even the problem size of them would send out his units in the morning that would go out to battle or wherever they might be guided if they were spreading doubtful and they would go at that time if they would go for battle they would go at that time we know that there's baraka in the mornings so one very good principle that's already within our dean is that you wake up in the morning you're prayed the father to prayer as soon as you pray the father to prayer don't get distracted in things that are just going to take your mind left and right put the phone away and absolutely focus on something that's important maybe that's I'm trying to do well in my studies maybe that's I'm trying to memorize Quran maybe that's some other goal that you've set for yourself anyway the simple point that I'm trying to make today is that the dean creates a paradigm for us and I think sometimes we take that for granted and in fact we fail to appreciate just what a big blessing that actually is and so when we're trying to organize our lives and I mentioned this because lots of people at the beginning of the year and we're about to come to the beginning of the year lots of people at the beginning of the year they make all these like what do you call those you know they set goals for themselves resolutions new years resolutions they set goals for themselves and it's not a bad thing it's a good thing it's not a bad thing to start at the beginning of the day and say what's what's my goal for today or to start at the beginning of the year and say what's my goal for today or to start you know at the end of Ramadan and say what do I have as my goal until the next Ramadan these are good things there's nothing wrong with it but we should be we should appreciate in the context of that that the dean creates or has established for us pillars and use leveraging those pillars is a very good way to achieve things a very good way to achieve things there's lots of barakah in that so just as a principle you might say to yourself you know Moghrib to Asha is family time I don't know depends on season winter may be different than summer but Moghrib to Asha is family time or Assaht Moghrib is family time you know this period is for this the Fajr to Vohra is for work Vohra to Ashaht is whatever again leverage the leverage the the construct of the dean along with the Sunnas that we also have the daily we have actually a very vividly described a day of the Prophet's eye sent them when you put together the Sunnah and if we leverage all of that that's how we achieve our goals now of course what are the goals anything good but maybe you have a personal goal to memorize some Quran maybe to achieve something at work maybe to maintain a consistent state of the good so we should appreciate the fact that the dean has already created a paradigm for us we should work to establish that very basic paradigm and of course the most essential of that is the prayers and we should build our lives around the prayers because when we attach things to the prayers and build our lives around the prayers it's much more likely to hold that structure is much more likely to stay in place because the prayers or the things that you know are absolutely non-negotiable and are always there and so to attach something to something that's art to to a firm pillar makes it much more likely that that goal is going to be anchored to something that's permanent and that of course leads to success over the longer period of time so Qayda as we enter into this new year and we set goals for ourselves I think it's very important for us to appreciate that Subhanallah we have this beautiful paradigm and we should be careful and considerate to appreciate it and to attach our goals accordingly May Allah's panawat Allah make us consistent in everything that pleases him
