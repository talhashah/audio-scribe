It means that we are removed from kufar which is the rejection of Allah's panawat ala and we're removed from shirk which is associating partners with Allah's panawat ala we're taken from that darkness and we're brought into the light of Tauhid Tauhid is the oneness of Allah's panawat ala that there is nothing to be worshipped except Allah's panawat ala so this is one light that's generated by the Shahada but there's a second light that's also generated by the Shahada what is that? It is the light of Risada Risada means that Allah's panawat ala sent messengers and in particular in our context the messenger is the Prophet Muhammad sallallahu alayhi wa sallam so there's two very very bright lights being generated by the Shahada now Subhanallah when a person goes from their world wherever that may be and moves into the realm of Islam these two lights are ignited they become bright, they become the companions of the person and that becomes their entry point these are the first steps that are taken in order for a person to enter into Dinn but after that as opposed to so many things in life where you pass the first lesson and then you come into something new after that all of the tests and all of the lessons essentially surround this main theme meaning that after this first concept of Tauhid and Risada is introduced into the heart and soul of an individual all of the tests and trials that come upon a person are all rotating around this same principle and it's just a life is just a continuous renewal of these two lights and that's one of the very unique features of Islam for example when you go to kindergarten you learn concept ABC&D but you don't necessarily repeat concept ABC&D in first grade and then in second grade and third grade but definitely by the time you're in sixth, seventh grade you're not going to be learning the principles of kindergarten although from one perspective some of the things you're learning kindergarten they're actually the real difficult challenges and you have to apply them throughout life but in the case of Islam you start with these two core principles Allah is one and He has sent messages in the context here namely Rasulullah so I send them and life then becomes a trial of these two principles it's just a constant trial for example first and weeks up in the morning and when they wake up in the morning they have to make a decision what decision didn't have to make they have to make a decision are they going to stay in bed or are they going to get up and pray I guess the first decision is that are you even going to wake up early in the morning once a person makes a decision they get up in the morning they have to decide what path they're going to take now what is that decision essentially? the decision is for the Muslim or for the one who's striving or struggling the decision is essentially going to be choosing between what does Allah's Panawaz Allah want of me and what did the Prophet's way send them guide me to if a person chooses that then that's an expression of their Shahada and if a person doesn't choose that then it's a reducing of their Shahada meaning it's a they fail to stand up to the challenge of whether or not the Shahada was true from their tongue now there's a very lengthy conversation so I don't want to go into many many new-ounce details but I just will say that it's interesting when you think about the concept of Rizala and the concept of Muhammad Rasulullah so I sent them were the principles established by Muhammad Rasulullah so I sent them that are scholars that make some interesting comments as to what that exactly means and I think we're very casual we say la ilaha illa Allah we really get that in the sense that we appreciate that okay what am I saying I'm saying that there is nothing absolutely nothing that I will worship except Allah's Panawaz Allah but what does it mean when we say Muhammad Rasulullah so I sent them what is the implication of that what is the meaning of that well fine from the tongue we're making a statement that we accepted the Prophet's way as the messenger of Allah's Panawaz Allah now what does that mean though that means that Allah chose messengers and it means that He chose the Prophet Muhammad so I sent them as His messenger and it comes with responsibilities for example the scholars they say that one of the responsibilities or maybe we can say one of the expressions one of the expressions of Muhammad Rasulullah so I sent them is that a person sees the Prophet so I sent them as their only guide what do we mean by that well you know that every day in life we choose the people that we're going to allow to guide us don't we make a decision if we're going to for example when a person watches a YouTube video in a way they've made a decision that the person who's producing the video has some ability to be able to provide them with something for example if I watch a YouTube video on how can I be a more spiritual person this pretend I searched that on YouTube how can I be more spiritual I click on the button I'm accepting that the person who's speaking has something to offer me otherwise why would I ever click on the button I'm thinking that this person may have something to offer me now how do I make that decision I might make that decision because it's the first link that comes up it's the first video that comes up I might make that decision because two billion two million I don't know how with the maximum number of followers a person can have but I don't know 10 million people watch this video so when man 10 million people watch this video I probably should watch it as well or maybe it's some tiktok 32nd thing and you know there's 500,000 people who liked it I'm making a decision some way shape or form that I'm going to invest my time in that particular channel and I'm going to take the advice that that person is giving me but when a person says Muhammad Rasulullah so I send them what they're one of the implications of that is that they appreciate that the prophet so I send them is my guide the prophet so I send them is my guide I will take what the prophet so I send them I will take the prophet so I send them as my guide that's the first step that's the first big principle I will take the prophet so I send them as my guide and Subhanallah I would even argue that in this day and age that's even more important that we appreciate what that means because we live in a time and place you know it used to be that you would hang around 5, 10, 15, 20 people maybe you connect with 20 people in a week and you kind of have to make a decision when you connect with those 20 people what opening am I going to give them to my heart and soul? who am I going to connect with? who am I going to relate to? who am I going to spend my time with? who am I going to turn my attention towards? where is my giblah? where is my direction? and it might be easy in life to decipher those 20 people for example you know there's the scholar in the masjid that I pray at so I'm going to when the scholar in the masjid speaks after Mughalah prayer I'm going to sit I'm going to give them my attention I'm going to put down my guard I'm going to share my heart I'm going to lend my ears I'm going to try to take the message that they're delivering and I'm going to try to bring it into my life there's a commitment there it's a quiet commitment but there's a contract there right? the person speaking Imam is speaking in your local masjid you're lowering your guard opening yourself making your heart available taking benefit from the advice and hoping that it penetrates the heart so that it creates a change within us so there's a little bit of a commitment there and every time we interact with anyone we're making a commitment if we're going to take advice from a person a person tells you hey I can tell you how you can become a millionaire so now you're a little interested your attention gets drawn the moment you turn in the direction of that person right person says something you turn you it peaks your interest either your heart turns or your body turns in that direction you're making a decision we're making a decision that this is someone who can give me advice and normally in life when there's 10-20 people you can kind of filter and you can say okay this is a person that I kind of keep close to but I don't let them advise me this is a person that I take deep advice from this is another person that I keep a distance from you can decipher but in this day and age it's like chaos out there it's chaos out there we have these devices in our pockets these devices are constantly inviting us to listen to A, B and C honestly even in the realm of Islamic scholars it's like a constant feat there's so many different things that are popping up and we have to make a decision internally are we taking these people as our messenger now that's lowercase messenger but whenever we take a lowercase messenger we have to ask ourselves the question does this person deliver me to the prophesied sentencing's message and in what way do they represent the prophesied sentencing in the sense that are they the inheritors of the prophesied sentencing so when we say Muhammad Rasulullah so I send them what we're appreciating one of the implications of that is that the prophesied sentencing is our guide now why is that important because Allah's panawadullah chose him and not only chose him but chose him as a guide to where chose him as a guide back to Allah's panawadullah so the prophesied sent them has no primary motive within him meaning he's not motivated to call us to himself nor is he motivated to take benefit from us so that he can benefit his pure motivation is that Allah's panawadullah ignited him ignited his heart with the passion of the love and obedience and pleasure of Allah's panawadullah and he guides people to that for the sake of Allah and Allah alone now why is that important because we have to appreciate that and in the context of that that's how we interact with the rest of the world when I make a decision about who I'm going to lend my ear to who am I going to lend my time to who am I going to give my space to I'm choosing essentially who my messengers are now these are lowercase messengers but I'm essentially choosing who my messengers are and again like I said that's a challenge that we face every day so I started by saying that the shahada is essentially the entry point into Islam but then the expression of that shahada becomes the daily challenge in Islam and I guarantee you that every person in this room is being challenged against their telheed okay now I'm not saying that anybody's going to bow to idols but we make little idols in our lives don't we don't we make our careers our careers idols and give them preference over what we should be doing for the sake of Allah don't we make our wealth idols little idols and give them preference over what we should be doing for the sake of Allah don't we give our pequeña the 작업 labor making our enclosure a little idol and sometimes give it preference over what we should be doing for the sake of Allah في المجردات نفسينا نحن نفسينا نحن نفسينا و هذا نفسينا هو the one whom we can trust و هذا نفسينا هو the one whom Allah has authorized و هذا نفسينا هو the one who guides us فقط لأنا سيك و who guides us to the path that leads to Allah's panel of knowledge و if we don't appreciate the implications of that what ends up happening is life challenges us في أيضении استد camar طرحة لだけ عند emphasizing the footprint of this idea that we are choosing who our messengers are و هذا نفسينا بالتفعل عالم كل شيء رسالة لطريقاء عند threadWHIR ASUD و لكن ہ place where Allah klass bunny و لكن ه 지역 إعلispers Here he gives us some kind of wealth مسالطワح�� لا more youth لتنどもئة لي إن ذام قادم David Zhang أنه أعطي أن هذا أخطي من الله that it's a blessing from Allah that it carries responsibilities towards Allah and that I have an opportunity in order to earn Allah's pleasure by spending it for the sake of Allah Isn't that what it is in that what wealth is? In fact, what did the Prophet say to them say سلقى بورهن is a proof سلقى is a proof What does this mean? سلقى is a proof It means that the proof of the Imam if a person truly has the iman يهجيًا للحدة، هذا هوiano my wealth هذه قديfound من أطellenني مثلك لكنه أخيرhyun أصاели عичего spoilا أنا جيس applauds فسيشي schwerًا إتي shifting لي أنه فieß Extra metricsن كاتب؟والي самكziehen أنا لأنه لا sh meditate懸 تقنعني أم ستencyل ،そهه أي quartoين54 beat, الambmonitionة حкладد أمسك مع الكلمةongoستأخ如果你 فها Idee Gold يأتي هواي فا<|he|> esperar أن هذا الوحددuel لا تبدπου فى آخره ان tiếp laptop اظن د nightmare تвигت بتفضله سوف تجعل să لنصاء التي We're in ourselves whether we buy food or whether we purchase an investment or we invest it in the hereafter for the sake of ourselves in the next life. Isn't that a test of the veils dropped? Let's just imagine for a second the veils dropped and we can see jenna before our eyes and we see Allah's penua'al al-Hawwah and whatever way people will see him in the hereafter you think that we would ever spend on ourselves and on our dreams and aspirations في the same way لا أعرف كل شيء سيكون كل شيء سيكون لأن what was unseen would become seen و if you saw a gennab of where you everything else would look completely decrepit there would be nothing there's no reality here except that it appears beautiful but we would see the truth and we would act differently so what is life? Life is simply just a test of Tulliq and also life is a test of Muhammad al-Azumallah so first and foremost principle to appreciate is as the scholars they say when a person takes the Shahada they're appreciating many many things about the Prophet's name they're appreciating that this is my messenger this is where I'm going to turn my attention to they're appreciating that he is authorized by Allah's panellatah Allah that he guides to Allah's panellatah Allah that we learn about how to achieve Allah's pleasure and how to avoid Allah's displeasure through the guidance of the messenger's al-Azumallah and whenever we're dealing with the world around us we should appreciate that there are lots of lowercase messengers in the world there's lots of lowercase messengers in the world but we don't turn our heart and attention except to Muhammad al-Azumallah so I send them and those who carry the authority who, why don't we say it this way those who seek to guide us in his authority and that's essential the scholars, they also say this is one implication of Muhammad al-Azumallah they also say that another implication of Muhammad al-Azumallah is to love the Prophet's al-Azumallah more than anyone including ourselves and that's also a part of our faith and that's a challenge now what happens is in life we fall in love with lots of people we fall in love with lots of people and either we fall in love because there is something pleasing to us if for example there might be someone that has extreme strength and we fall in love with them there might be someone who has extreme skill so we fall in love with them there might be someone who has extreme wisdom so we fall in love with them there might be someone who has extreme beauty so we fall in love with them meaning our heart gets attracted to them and those have their place that is part of life however Statort ofンド والدuce وفعل التحوط من للوق onlyوضى تحوط تحوط بحيات اللونة تحوط بأesty periba ذنين لتحوط بحيات اللونة

سوف أعرف هذه اللاء منتهة and we should appreciate that about the Prophet's name and we should comfortably love that. now why am I harping on this? because nowadays we quickly make decisions about what we like and don't like on very very superficial criteria. for example, we interact with somebody for five minutes and we think they're like a very kind person. أو إنتراء بإمكانكم في مرحباً و they appear to be seeking our best interest and so we say this is a very nice person but there may be some kindness in that person, there may be some nicity in that person but we don't have the full picture except in the case of the Prophet's eye sent them meaning that the Prophet's eye sent them was connected to Allah's Prophet and the Prophet's eye sent them his character was verified by Allah's Prophet's eye his character was verified by Allah's Prophet's eye in the sense that the Prophet's eye sent them to Allah very you are upon a great character so the Quran is testifying to the character of the Prophet's eye one of the implications of Muhammad Rasulullah's eye sent them is to have a deep love for the character of the Prophet's eye sent them another implication sometimes it's a little more difficult to appreciate but it's very important is to have a love for the family of the Prophet's eye sent them notice that whenever we send Salawat and Salam on the Prophet's eye sent them we're often sending upon his family while Ali went upon the family of Ibrahim Ali's and the Prophet Muhammad's eye sent them so why would we have to send blessings upon his family? why are we sending blessings upon the family of Ibrahim Ali's and the family of the Prophet's eye sent them because the fan... nobody exists in a vacuum I mean one of the wisdom is that nobody exists in a vacuum when the Prophet's eye sent them takes on the responsibility of being the Prophet's eye sent them in the sense that Allah's Prophet's eye sent them puts up responsibility on his shoulders it's not only the responsibility of a singular person rather it's a responsibility carried by a singular person and supported by people around him the companions, the family of the Prophet's eye sent them supported the Prophet's eye sent them they sacrificed for the Prophet's eye sent them they gave up the Prophet's eye sent them in the sense that they released him from his obligations towards them and encouraged him to service us so because of that we appreciate that we recognize that and we have a deep love for the family of the Prophet's eye sent them by the way this is just a more general theme this exists in life as well for example whatever your local muster is there's going to be an Imam in the muster correct? who is you know literally a job is to serve the community day and night and when these Imam's in the muster or our teachers are servicing us there's great sacrifice that comes from behind the scenes if a Imam is sitting and serving and spending time speaking with person A, person B, person C, person D that means that while they're sitting and speaking to A, B, C and D they took their attention from away from their own family they took their attention away from their own other responsibilities their human beings in the end now I can't speak to it from that angle but I can speak to it from for example the medical angle because that's my background I can tell you that when there's a doctor for example comes in the, comes under a doctor it doesn't matter any healthcare provider when they come in the door and they begin to serve a patient or they serve their let's say 30, 40 patients for that day they have to leave all their problems at the front door they can't be like thinking about all their problems while they're trying to serve these 40 people that they're going to take care of during the day when a surgeon is sitting and doing surgery they have to 100% focus on the patient and leave all their problems at the door it's not that they don't have problems they have problems they have stresses they have family issues they have people in their family that might be sick they have people in their family that they have responsibility to but they give up all of that and leave it all at the door in order to be able to service in order to be able to service the people that they service the same is true of our scholars the same is true of the scholars who inherited from the prophesies sent them all the way up to the time of the prophesies so we appreciate that so the scholars they say that another responsibility that arises from the shahada is that a person appreciate that have a deep love for the family of the prophesies sent them it's not that they only make dua for the prophesies sent them but they appreciate the sacrifices of the family of the prophesies sent them and they send peace and blessings upon the family of the prophesies sent them just as we are assigned to do in every single prayer anyway the summary for today is that the very very first concept that bring us into this theme are the exact same concepts that are tested throughout our journey in the deed we make a claim of Dohid by saying that Ila Allah in the law and life then becomes a big test of this Dohid and we're tested in different ways sometimes we're tested with wealth sometimes we're tested with poverty or difficulty sometimes we're tested with blessings sometimes we're tested with illness sometimes we're tested with a person that shows up in our lives and says something or does something or behaves in a certain way there's just innumerable tests that arise but all of them are asking the same question do you appreciate that there's no place to turn except Allah do you appreciate that there's no true doer in the universe except Allah that he is the true file, the true doer do you appreciate that there is no one that is worthy of worship except Allah do you appreciate that there's no one worthy of appreciation of looking at with that magnificence meaning turning to with that magnificence except Allah isn't that what life is just a big test of that I know there's in different names and different situations and different circumstances and different trials and we give them names and we calculate them and try to figure them out but I'm just telling you these are all thrown at us by Allah in order to test our faith in Him so this is the first test and the second test is we make a second entry point is we make a statement of the risada Muhammad Rasulullah Allah is Allah sent them and that also is a big challenge for us do we love the Prophet's hand more than we love ourselves do we appreciate the sacrifices that he made do we take him as the true messenger removing all other quote-unquote messengers in our lives all of these are trials that arise regularly we're constantly being tested in this and Sahaba were also tested in the same thing and if you go through the trials of the Sahaba you'll see that it was very similar they were tested in their faith in Allah and they were tested in their attachment to Rasulullah so I said them so this is one of the ways by which we should think about the shahada and in fact we can say one of the things that we can say here is that if a person ever wants to gauge their progress in this Dean that is the last point it's simply to ask two questions do I really behave as if la ilaha illa Allah do I really behave as if la ilaha illa Allah and do I really accept Muhammad Rasulullah these are the two questions and that you can ask yourself any day of the week any moment of your life you can ask yourself these two questions and you'll know exactly where you are and the path to Allah's panel of the world it's as simple as that may Allah's panel of the world make us amongst those who are able to inculcate the shahada into our hearts and souls and may He make us amongst those who are able to live a life of Taheed may He make us amongst those who accept the Prophet's life and they're as our true messenger in guide and I'll say that Allah's panel of the world is among those who are able to live a life of Taheed
