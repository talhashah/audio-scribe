أنا في ال novo ثم اعشون تسؤول حسينك و he says this is for you and this is a gift for me let's see if he was sitting in the house of his mother and father what type of gift he would receive let's see if he was sitting in the house of his mother and father what type of gift he would receive and then the prophet Simon continued and he sent she gave a warning about how people will show up on the day of judgment and if something isn't truly theirs what a burden it will be on them how people will show up on the day of judgment and if something truly wasn't there what a burden it will be on them all right first of all this is not some story meaning in the sense that this is a Bukhari in Muslim this narration it's found in Bukhari in Muslim if I recall correctly or at least Bukhari or Muslim but my recollection is both let's point one so it's important for us to be able to understand some principles that we can learn from this now on the face of it there's one important point to recognize we do think all of us can recognize which is that if for example we go someplace and there's we have some responsibility and we're given something that doesn't truly belong to us as part of that responsibility for example let's take for an example that this was like a bribe or that this was a mechanism to influence the collector to perhaps overlook something right that's one lesson that can be great that can be gained while we're being reminded here that any such circumstance is exceedingly dangerous for the one who participates in it so that's very important for example if I have a role whatever it might be in society in this case the Zakaq collector okay and let's just say that as part of that role I go and someone tries to give me something which could bias the way in which I handle the circumstance then this is a very very dangerous game to play with so much so that it caused the problem I sent them to stand on the member sit on the member and to announce to the people the dangers of it so this is one lesson that we can we can gain but another lesson which is very important is that when something is done for the sake of Allah it whole we are held to a different standard and that applies to all of us by the way the first applies to all of us but the presumption is that most people wouldn't be in that situation correct but this does which is that when we do something for the sake of Allah then it has to be purely for the sake of Allah there can be nothing that would taint that whatsoever and we have to take that standard and do two things with it number one it's the standard by which we recognize who we're going to enter into the our closest proximity who we're going to bring into our hearts there's a standard that we hold them to and number two there's a standard that we in turn hold ourselves to to ensure that we represent Islam and those people in that way for example and I'm being a little bit as a tarakir but just for example one of the great blessings of Islam and we have to recognize this because it's so important in this day and age one of the great blessings of Islam is that the Prophet's al-A'isham held himself to the highest ethical standard the Prophet's al-A'isham held himself to the highest ethical standard so we can be comforted in that you know we don't need to make excuses for the Prophet's al-A'isham you see the word the way the world works today look at the political world you know they say one thing and then they do another thing you know they say rule of law rule of law and then they run on part in friends and relatives and this stuff is complete garbage you have to make excuses for them you have to make all these reasons why they behave in the way in which to behave that's not ethics that's politics ethics is you look at something and it's so pristine so pure that you don't need to make a single excuse in fact it forces you to look at yourself and find your errors and that's the ethics of the Prophet's al-A'isham you know I think the greatest example of that which we've covered here previously on a Saturday evening is just the verse Abbas Awata'uallah you all know that verse right Abbas Awata'uallah he frowned and he turned away now you know this was a revelation which arose in the context of the Prophet's al-A'isham burning his attention away from someone who was coming to seek some benefit from him and instead focusing his attention on the you know responsible members of the Quraysh not for his own not out of his own desire not out of the Prophet's al-A'isham's own desire but rather the Prophet's al-A'isham I mean you know the circumstance but essentially the Prophet's al-A'isham is trying to give Dala to the Quraysh particularly the leaders of the Quraysh this individual who happens to be a blind companion begins to approach the Prophet's al-A'isham and because of his status because his status wasn't at the level of the Quraysh that he was sitting with the leaders of the Quraysh that he was sitting with the Prophet's al-A'isham became a bit conflicted conflicted in the sense like hey I need to give this person some information some knowledge because he's coming to me but he's not at the status of the people that I'm sitting with and also it's going to distract me from the people that I'm speaking with and this person could come anytime but this is a shot on goal I can actually give a message to the Quraysh and deliver it they're listening to me I'm engaging with them and I can speak with this companion later so in the context of that the Prophet's al-A'isham he frowned he didn't say anything he just frowned and turned away and Subhanallah revelation came from Allah's Subhanallah saying that he frowned and he turned away and the attention should have been on this individual rather than the Quraysh okay now here essentially these two things are almost not even neutral but it almost makes sense the scholars say it makes sense why the Prophet's al-A'isham was turning away from this individual he's already speaking with the Quraysh like I mentioned he is trying to alleviate the difficulty of all the companions because they're being persecuted by the Quraysh by delivering his message and maybe gaining a little headway in with the leaders of the Quraysh so all the reasons there's many and I don't have time to go into them but all the reasons are there why he should have turned away and when he turns away he doesn't say anything he just frowns and by the way who is he frowning towards he's frowning towards a companion who's blind he can't even see the frown yet what yet Allah Subhanallah reveals Abbas Awata Walla to highlight the standard at which the Sunnah is held the standard at which the Sunnah is held meaning the standards of the Sunnah are so exacting that even when the Prophet's al-A'isham turns away with good reason from a blind individual who can't even see the frown it's going to be noted and reset to show that the Sunnah is held at a very high standard and it's exactly that standard that you found that you find woven throughout the entire sera it's not like they say one of the scholars he wrote and it really resonated with me he said there was no night too dark except that the companions knew what the Prophet's al-A'isham was doing and there was no wall so high except that the Prophet's al-A'isham knew except that the companions knew what was happening behind that wall this was the status of the Prophet's al-A'isham the darkest of nights companions would be watching and they would find him in the deepest of prayer not doing the things that everybody does in the darkness of night and there was no wall too high meaning the Prophet's al-A'isham is sitting with his family behind the privacy of the wall of the house and the family is delivering exactly how the Prophet's al-A'isham behaved where are you going to find that in history where do you find such consistency in history now what does that do for us that provides us with two benefits with one responsibility and one benefit one benefit the benefit the benefit of among many but the benefit is that we can call this man our messenger and be absolutely comforted in the fact that we don't need to make an excuse now I know that we live in a world of YouTube where people want to you know attack the Prophet's al-A'isham and they'll bring up some random event here and there which is totally within the confines of excellence but the way people think today you know they make you think like you got to defend it but we're not making excuses that's the way society was at that time and the Prophet's al-A'isham excelled in the context in which he existed we're not making any excuses you just have to understand the circumstance but the Prophet's al-A'isham who was consistent in the darkest of nights behind the highest of walls and so when someone is assigned a task by the Prophet's al-A'isham to go and collect the Zaka on behalf of this nascent umman and he says that oh all of this is yours but this is a gift for me the Prophet's al-A'isham becomes very angry very upset very disturbed why? because this is a conflict of interest at the highest ethical level it's a conflict of interest when someone for in two ways number one when someone does something for the sake of Allah it has to be halisatan for the sake of Allah 100% pure for the sake of Allah there cannot be anything that adulterates that intention there's no toleration for anything that adulterates that attention what do you mean you went for Zaka to collect the Zaka and you picked up a gift along the way no it's not acceptable it's not acceptable because actually the question is if you were sitting home would you have even been offered such a gift that was not the time to take gift number one number two so it has to be purely for the sake of Allah and number two there's no room to allow for external influences to disrupt your service of yourself in the community now you look at today I mean forget about today we look at ourselves we don't have to look at the world what's the benefit of looking at the world they're going to do what they want to do we want to benefit from this we should look in the mirror when we do something for the sake of Allah we cannot ever expect to have anything in return in fact it should be the opposite we should say I don't want anything in return I'm not going to accept this there's zero that's going to come from you because I am doing this for the sake of Allah and I'm only doing this because Allah has given me the opportunity to do that I'll give you like a very simple small example just to think about for example brother is assisting with the musjid all right so brother is assisting with the musjid or sister's assisting with the musjid and there's some event in the musjid okay so they go and they say you know uh okay I'll take care of every all the expenses I'll just buy it on my own card and you just reimburse me at the end okay now after the event you know they spent a couple thousand dollars on behalf of the musjid they did a favor to the musjid but honestly they're not doing any favor to the musjid they're really doing a favor to themselves that they got a chance to participate in the service of the musjid now they got at least points on their card they're like oh wow I spent the money on the musjid and yeah I got extra some points so now I can like you know maybe my next trip is going to be a little bit easier or I can get a free couple coffees or whatever might you might get out of these points but again there's a conflict of interest here now it might be very very subtle and everybody might say what are you talking about that's crazy they spent their card they should get the chance to get the points but no that's not the point the idea here is that you did something for the sake of Allah you should never expect anything in return and in fact I would argue that you stick the points and donate them to the musjid because they belong to the musjid because if you were sitting in your parents house you think you would have collected any of those points it was a gift on you to be able to participate in the musjid to be able to contribute to the opportunity of the musjid if you got points secondarily for that then that's not some gift that is actually a chance to give back so that inshallah you get the chance in the future and in fact what's the problem here the problem you say what's a big deal the big deal is the next time you're going to jump up to raise your hand say hey I'll use my card because hey I can collect another 5,000 points because again I spent on behalf of the musjid so we have a standard that we hold ourselves to and that is that when we do something for the sake of deen we have zero expectation in return I'm serving the musjid I don't have an expectation that well then I'm going to be able to you know get special access to some place of the musjid so I'm going to be able to get different treated a little differently because I'm participating in the musjid or you know I'm the Imam so now I'm going to get some kind of special treatment because I'm the Imam no if I'm the Imam it's actually the opposite I'm getting the opportunity to serve I have to hold myself to an even higher standard I have to ask the harder questions like I have to make sure that there's no special benefit given to me that's the truest expression of deen and that's the standard that the prophet's eye sent them held the companions to because that was the standard that he was held to as well and so panelah that's a gift because we can comfortably put our hand in his hand metaphysically we can comfortably put our hand in his hand and trust him because we see the life that he lived and the same can be said of the generations that came after these are the types of standards that the people of the highest echelon hold themselves to you know I see this for example just in my own profession you know people come by these drug reps they historically used to come by it's a lot better now but when I was earlier in my career it was much worse these drug groups come by they tell you about their drug and they give you pens and pencils and notepads and you know other stickers and gifts you know what do you mean you think you would be giving me you think they're handing out stickers to people and gifts to people on the street no they're handing these things out to bias me right because I take these things home I give them to my kids I give them to my family my family gets excited I think the next time they come that I'm going to get more I'll give them even more free water bottle free this free that but what are they really trying to do they're really trying to influence me number one so that one the first thing that I think about when I'm thinking about that class of drug is their drug so that's already a bias and number two I'm thinking that if I don't regularly prescribe this drug this representative is not going to come back and give me more gifts the next time this is a subtle slight of hand by which people try to influence my service of others and it's dangerous and in fact now you know medicine has eventually come to their senses and I know that most hospitals have like restrictions on this type of thing where they can give some small amount they can't buy you breakfast every week this and that but whatever it is the point is we have to be cognizant that particularly in the aspect of dean when we do something for the sake of Allah it is a gift on us we would be sitting in our parents homes otherwise and asking the question where did this gift come from that's the standard that we have to all hold ourselves to in anything that we do for the sake of Allah there should be never never we should never allow anything to compete with our intention nothing she can compete with our intention and we should never allow a circumstance in which we take a tiny even the tiniest of benefit from a secondary circumstance except that we're looking for Allah's benefit and Allah's grace and Allah's mercy and Allah's reward solely and believe me this is a very hard thing because inevitably it's human nature to want to take slight benefits from circumstances that we find ourselves in and in fact that is why you find all of this drug reps and mileage points and all this stuff you know why are these what are these airlines have all this mileage points maybe one is you keep a bunch of people happy but the other is like look they know that the big people who are buying stuff you know buying large numbers of tickets for their offices these you know agencies and this and that that if they give them a bunch of mileage points then when they're choosing between two airlines they're going to prefer their airline so I'm in charge of my office and I'm booking you know for like I don't know hundreds of people and I'm collecting points then of course I'm going to like be biased towards the way in which I make my purchases whether that's like I'm purchasing some place or using some card or whatever it might be these things are there to influence our behavior believe me they're not like giving us some kind of rewards quote-unquote as if we're like doing good deeds and we're getting a jannah these are not those right rewards these are mechanisms by which you maintain loyalty mechanisms by which you influence behavior mechanisms by which you cause people to make selections in certain circumstances and these things can potentially conflict with the reason why which we do things the reason for which we do things so when we number one we can hold our so we can comfortably put ourselves in the put our lives in the hand of the Sunnah because the Sunnah has been held to such an exacting standard and that exacting standard is not some you know inconsistent inconsistent standard it's highly consistent from the earliest days of the sawhatewalla from the earliest days of the Syrah all the way until the world is peering in like I said towards the end of the time of the prophet I sent them the Arabia Arabia is peering in at the darkness of the night and watching what the prophet I sent them does Arabia is asking the question what happens behind the highest of walls and everything can be revealed and it's absolutely consistent purely for the sake of Allah's peace and peace and peace and peace without any taint whatsoever that's benefit for us we can comfortably submit to that and by the way this is a standard I challenge you to hold to anybody that you want to give your heart to anyone that you want to take advice from anybody that you want to give your heart to anyone that you want to submit to anyone that you think that you're going to follow where everybody wants to you know now the world is made up of followers and all this stuff ask this question ask this question what's happening in the darkest of night ask this question what's happening behind the highest of walls ask this question what is the consistency from the beginning to the end ask this question what motivates this person is it their benefit or mine ask this question how does this person deal with the most subtle of circumstances do they stand up and tell the world that they should be so pure that they should be so dedicated that they should never take the chance of mixing the reward in this life with the reward in the here the reward of the here after with the reward of this life ask this question see who you find see who you find challenge to everybody in the room challenge to the world forget about everybody in the room see who you find you won't find anyone go I use all of history that's the beauty of this of the fact that we have the prophesy something as our messenger and that's the standard that we're going to hold anybody to and after we hold that standard after we hold the prophesy I send them to that exacting standard and submit we're going to turn around and replicate that on ourselves that's the challenge we're going to turn around and replicate that on ourselves and hold ourselves to the same standard what am I doing in the darkness of the night what am I doing behind the highest of walls am I consistent from the beginning of the day to the end these are the challenges that we're going to hold ourselves to and we're going to hold ourselves to this same standard as well that if I was sitting in the house of my what I've received the same gift what I've received the same benefit what I'd be able to you know have this same perk that's a question if something is done truly for the sake of Allah whether that's dinner dunya if something is done truly for the sake of Allah then it's truly for the sake of Allah there's no there's no competition there there's no secondary intention there's nothing that we can allow to tug away at the purity of our faith and the purity of our intention so this is the challenge that we again it provides us with this beautiful benefit of being able to submit to something so great but it also holds us to that same standard so that we have to turn around and reflect upon ourselves why am I prescribing this medication why am I behaving in this way what are my expectations when I walk into a certain place do I expect to be treated differently than the rest no everyone should be treated the same so subhanAllah the beauty of now again I apologize that I just talking of the top of my head here I'm getting a little heated as well but anyway the point is that if I made any mistake I apologize but you can go back and read this incident like I said it's in the books of Imam Bukhari Muslim you know at least those two according to my recollection but it's such a powerful subhanAllah it's just so honestly it's so comforting it's so comforting to know that I'm part of this tradition and it's difficult I agree that we have to hold ourselves to such standard but you'll find if you actually go back in our history that the pious of our predecessors the most pious of our predecessors they help themselves to this exact same standard and it's because of that that they reach the echelons of being able to ignite the hearts of the people around them and we live on that and whether you like it or not we're standing on that solid soil we are standing on that solid soil and we should appreciate that about the Sunnah about the companions about the Pope's eye son and about all of the pious predecessors that came before because without that what would we be on we would be standing on this like floating weak foundation but we're on such firm ground the last thing we want to do is like become the layer the unstable layer that the generations after us will have to stand on may Allah's panawatsah Allah make us amongst those who do everything solely for His sake may He protect us from ever being influenced in a way that would be de-spleasing to Allah's panawatsah Allah and ever taking a circumstance where we take some sort of second it takes some sort of benefit that we shouldn't be taking a male sponored male sponored Allah keep us held to the highest of standards male is not going to make allow us to be able to appreciate the high standards of our Dean and allow us to be able to hold ourselves such high standards such that we can succeed in the hereafter well khuratat waana
