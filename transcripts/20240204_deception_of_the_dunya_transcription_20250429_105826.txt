 حمد لله وكفى والسلام ونعلى إباده الذين استفى أما بعض فأوض بالله من الشيطان الرجيم اسم الله الرحمن الرحيم والذين جاهدوا فينا لنا هندي لهم سبولنا سبحان ربك رب الذي تأما يصفون والسلام ونعلى المرسلين والحمد لله رب العالمين الله مسلل على سيدنا محمد وعلى أذي سيدنا محمد وبارك وسلم والله مسلل على سيدنا محمد وعلى أذي سيدنا محمد وبارك وسلم والله مسلل على سيدنا محمد وعلى أذي سيدنا محمد وبارك وسلم أ one of the features of life is that within it there are circumstances that are very deceiving and what I mean by deceiving here is that you look at the circumstance and you are completely convinced of A but the truth is B you look at a circumstance and you're convinced of A but the truth is B and these types of circumstances they exist in a spectrum the most extreme is that which completely dups you and dups you in something that is amongst the most important aspects of your life right? I mean for example sometimes you can be swindled in something small it's not a big deal because it's relatively small and sometimes you can be swindled in something major and it's a really big deal particularly if that circumstance is just completely deceiving you so this is just an nature of life it's often full of deception this principle actually is introduced to us in the very very first interaction that we have with the Quran in the sense that if you read Fatiha as soon as you pass Fatiha you get to Al-Bakara and Al-Bakara essentially begins maybe like the first 20 ayat or so begins by dividing mankind into three groups I mean you can open it up and read it but again the number of the ayat I'm just you know it might not be 20 it might be 21 but roughly 20 verses the first five verses beginning with Alif Lam Mim that talks about believers the next two verses talks about disbelievers and then several verses talk about hypocrites now who are hypocrites? hypocrites are the ones who present themselves to be one way making you absolutely convinced that they're that way but are actually swindling you because they're completely the other way and it's had a great harm and detriment to you or to the Dean so look how I'm very quickly look around presents us and by the way I mean this is just one angle in the sense that you know in life there's in life we encounter this all the time you make friends with somebody who's really not sure or you think someone's your friend but they're really not your friend or you think that there's benefit in something but there's really no benefit in it or for example look at 2007 you know in 2007 they had this whole world economy almost collapsed in 2006 2007 that time frame the whole world economy almost collapsed and everybody was swindled into thinking that you know they can just buy this real estate and all of a sudden this real estate we'll just keep going up and up and up and there's no way you can lose any money everybody began to jump on board and everybody was stressing themselves as thin as thin as thin as possible until the whole thing snapped and the whole world economy was literally on the brink of collapse all these countries that to come in just to save the economies of these nations because everybody had been duped by almost by each other they had just created this this sort of this game now like I said these exist in life you can't avoid it we're all going to face it we completely think one thing is we think something is one way and only after time does it reveal it's up to be a completely completely upside down but I think it's important for us to know one thing for sure which is that of all of the possible deceptions and there's many we already talked about some but of all of the possible deceptions the biggest deception is the dunya of all of the possible deceptions the biggest deception is the dunya dunya means the life of this world and the reason it's such a deception is because it purports itself to be good and lasting but no one ever ends up good or lasting and everybody wakes up pursuing it it advertises itself to be one way it sparkles it shines it glitters it drives the world but in the end it never fulfills its claim and always delivers everyone who experiences it to some end or another which essentially is going to be death for everyone look I mean just as an example if first of all so much of what the dunya advertises itself to be is not true person thinks if I get the dunya I'll be happy but happiness is rarely found in the dunya particularly when that becomes the goal of a person person thinks if I get the dunya I'll be strong but the dunya wears a person away until they're weak every okay the dunya offers multiple different pathways but everyone every one of those pathways leads to a dead end there is no pathway in the dunya except that it leads to a dead end it's a maze it's like a maze of multiplicity you have all these options at any given moment you look like you have a hundred options ahead of you yeah I could do this and I can do this and I'll make this and I'll make that and I'll get this and then I'll buy that and then I'll save this and then I'll capture that I'm going to meet this person I'm going to do that but in the end every one of those options even though there's literally millions when you put them all together amongst you know cement them amongst the crowd even here but in the end every one of them is in a dead end because look in the end whatever you gain is never lasting okay you could collect all of the dunya all of the wealth of the dunya and at best you'll die one day and all your inheritors will distribute it and probably even fight over it to be honest you can't take it with you because this like filter of death precludes even a penny crossing it so there's no way that a person can no matter even the most successful can never take it with them you could collect all the strength that's humanly possible you could literally be the strongest person the strongest person on the planet you can bench you can do this you can do that but in the end the dunya will weaken the body and reduce you to just bones you could have the perfect life where every single thing that you thought was a goal is attained but the dunya will deliver your death and it'll all be taken away you have health you eventually become sick if you're young you eventually become old if you're rich you eventually die and it goes to someone else even if you found the perfect companion either they die or you die and then life moves on nothing this dunya advertises itself to be one way and purports to be something but it's completely opposite and the beauty of Islam is that in okay let's take a step back in this dunya there are tiny tiny pockets of up true opportunity tiny pockets of true opportunity they're they're just a few that actually are truly meaningful and lasting and Islam the beauty of Islam is that it filters everything and with just absolute clarity shows you a straight path and it is the only path out of all the possible paths that is straight and that leads to leads you to a destination beyond it which is the destination to Allah and to his pleasure and a truly lasting reward which can never exist here but actually does exist somewhere which is beyond here that's the straight path and the beauty of Islam is that it filters the whole dunya and tells us that like within this dunya these are the things that are valuable what are the things that are okay this time at this place at this time out of the thousand opportunities you have actually the true opportunity is to pray the Fajr prayer at this period of your life the true opportunity is to pray the Vahra prayer at this period of your life when you've been given blessed with wealth the true opportunity is to pay Zakat and to give some extra Sallaka if you can eventually get to that point out of all of the chaos and despite all of the deception and despite how much the dunya claims itself to be something but eventually drops everybody at a dead end the the the only thing that filters and makes things clear and brings light upon the truth of the dunya is the deen in fact there's a narration in the book of Imam Tidmihi which it's I started this way because I was reading this narration but there's a book in the there's a narration in the book of Imam Tidmihi in which the Prophet's SallAllahu Alaihi Wasallam said that and he's making a comparison I'm just going to keep it very simple here but he did the Prophet's SallAllahu Alaihi Wasallam is establishing that this dunya is not even worth the wing of a mosquito mosquito is just a translation that's used a wing of a nat to the wing of a mosquito to in the eyes of Allah's Panawatullah Prophet's SallAllahu Alaihi Wasallam the only few things in dunya that are of value are the things that the deen teaches us of how we can behave in the dunya so that we can attain value and so that we can pass this dunya to actually achieve the true reward which is the reward to us. So the other thing is that we can achieve the true reward which is the reward to us that we can achieve the true reward which is the reward of the hereafter and that's because this dunya is a test. Now what is the actual the battle that's going on? The dunya wants to claim itself to be the goal. The dunya wants to claim itself to be the reward. The dunya wants to claim itself to be the focal point but the deen is reminding us that this dunya is not a goal this dunya is not a focal point this dunya is not the end it is not permanent it is merely a test and like any test the time of test is not the time of reward the time of test is to is to earn the highest points so that we can gain a reward and that's something that all of us have to remember. Subhanallah I mean how many stories do you see where the dunya completely flips on a person's face just in a moment everything is going well all of a sudden someone can die in an instant meaning like a close relative can die your child can die something you weren't expecting can happen a crime can arise and you know you can be the victim of a crime etc etc life just no matter no matter if anyone thinks if anyone thinks for a minute but like hey I'm getting like this I'm enjoying it's not it's so deceiving that it makes you think the dunya makes you think that I'm enjoying and that nothing can go wrong but it's exactly at that moment that things will go wrong how many husbands and wives you know will have their spouse just pass away unexpectedly how many parents will have their children passed away unexpectedly how many difficult circumstances can you identify in the world in which people are suffering this dunya is not the end point this dunya has a zero value to Allah's panel of tele it's not like I've said before it's it is the it is the creation that was designed to be destroyed what's the end result of this dunya except to be reduced to dust the only true and lasting and permanent reward is in the akhir well akhirة الخيرو and the akhirة is better but the whole of the world is being warned here the Quran is warning us you guys prefer but the whole of the world you guys prefer the dunya the life of the dunya why because it's deceiving us it's making us think that it's something it's making us think that it's special and it's so quickly deceives us that I get deceived and then I talk it up with my neighbor my neighbor gets deceived and then they come and talk it up with the next person they get deceived it just spreads viral spread viral and the heart is such that it easily gets duped by this but to theory on the hayat of dunya you guys all prefer the life of this world well akhirة الخيرو and ابقى but the akhirة is better well ابقى and lasting and that's exactly the case of the dunya it claims to be better but actually the only the only good lies in jannah meaning you can you know we we we call a house here a house we call food here food we call companionship companionship but none of these things are true meaning this is not a house this is a placeholder there'll be a day in shahla we'll go to jannah we'll see a house and we'll have some resemblance to the houses that we had here but you can't ever compare and there'll be a day shahla will be in jannah you'll eat you'll eat a piece of fruit it'll have some resemblance to the fruit that you had here but you won't ever be able to compare and there'll be a day in jannah where there'll be companionship and it'll be with families and spouses and friends etc but you'll look back and you'll remember this world and it'll just be a semblance of that meaning it'll that the world will have been a semblance of reality the true reality will be seen there because it's way better and it's lasting and like I said lasting because nothing in this world lasts it doesn't matter if you found the perfect companion you found the perfect wealth you found the perfect food you found something that you claim to be perfect in this world either it doesn't last or you don't last in fact i would argue actually we don't have to argue it's true both don't last you we definitely won't last there's nobody staying here more than x number of years and even if you made something perfect itself it won't last like i said so many times you you can build your dream home and spend all the time and energy building your dream home and the next person will tear it down and say this is a tear down this is not a dream home this is a tear down and this is exactly what people do today don't you think of the 1950s people were building their dream homes or in the 1970s people were building their dream homes they thought this is the perfect home this is the home that will last forever and what happens you know 50 years later person comes in this is a tear down just we have to redo this this is this wrong and that wrong it was the nature of the dunya so we should never be deceived and that's the beauty one of the beauties of this dean this the beauty of this dean is that the prophesy isendom and the prophets that came before the message of the Quran is very very clear that this world is not a world of reward yes there are some benefits that we gain from this world that Allah SWT blesses us with there is some good in this world but this is not a place of reward this is a place of test and the true reward comes in the hereafter so again just as a summary the world is full of deception and all of us will experience that deception unfortunately that's the nature of life there will be people that we bump into that will deceive us there will be issues that deceive us there will be circumstances in life that deceive us but the greatest deception lies in the dunya itself and the great one of the great features of this dean is that it can't the dunya can't deceive us because we've been told its reality you know it's very sad once you think someone to be your friend and they let you down and they reveal themselves to be completely opposite of your friend right because you had no expectation or we had no expectation of that it was completely unexpected you know people get very upset when they expect it expected a but it actually turns out to be b but here in this matter the dunya is the biggest deceiver because it takes us in our lives and our energy and our time and our focus and leads us to a dead end but the dean is the greatest clarifier it sheds the ultimate light on this reality to allow us to be able to appreciate exactly what it is so that on the day of judgment or even earlier than that when we go to our grave we don't have to be fooled and then regretting so we should open our eyes to this reality this is what the straight path is this is exactly you know this is the Sunnah but one one one one way to define the Sunnah is the mechanism by which the prophesies send them engaged the dunya vis-a-vis the opportunity for the hereafter and maybe the best summary is there where the prophesies send them says that this that you be like a traveler be like a traveler in this world you're coming and going don't be deceived don't think this is the destination there is actually true destination and that's the greatest warning that we've been given it's one of the greatest warnings that we've been given so we should appreciate the dunya for what it is we should make the adjustments in life that are necessary to particularly to by recognizing that Islam the Islam filters for us what is good in this dunya it reminds us that in this dunya there are a few things that are worthy and that we can actually take advantage of those things to create for ourselves a much better circumstance a true a true final lasting and much better circumstance in the hereafter and if we don't then the fault is not anyone on anyone except ourselves we've been given that message and it's been given to us with utter clarity may Allah's panel tell them make us amongst those who are able to appreciate the deception of the dunya may he make us amongst those who turn our focus to the hereafter and may he make us amongst those who are able to attain the great rewards that Allah has prepared for those who focus on it wa al-khurat al-Awanah and in the hamd al-in-na'ih wa bin al-Alamin and in the hereafter and in the hereafter and in the hereafter and in the hereafter and in the hereafter
