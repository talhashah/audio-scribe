 الحمل لله وكفى والسلام على إباده الذي نصفه أما بعد فأوذ بالله من الشيطان الرجيم اسم الله الرحمن الرحيم والذين جاهدوا فينا لنا هدي أنهم سبولنا سبحان ربك رب للزد أما يصفون والسلام على المرسلين والحمل لله رب العالمين والشر凅ر eines الأcticamente وهنا برحب و today we're going to speak about another dimension of the Surah. It's not another dimension actually, it's the same theme but I'm just going to have you appreciate it from a different angle in Shal'a. L'Quran is a message from Allah's panel to Allah to all of mankind. And essentially it's a journey. لقد تفعل القرآن وكيف تفعل الفاتحة. والفاتحة is the opening. تفعل some basic tenants and highlights major themes that are going to be carried throughout the entire Quran. And then SubhanAllah you continue on with the Lifla meam. You move into Bukhara, Al Bukhara and as you move into Al Bukhara you begin to تفعل القرآن في هذا الجرنة of understanding Allah, understanding how to understand the created world in which we exist, how to understand the consequences of our behavior in this world, what those consequences are whether they be Jannah or Jannahm, the various messengers that came before and how they dealt with their communities and how their communities dealt with them. What is the straight path? Who are those historically that have been on the straight path? What are the characteristics of those who have taken the straight path? What is the path of those who are a straight? What are their characteristics, etc., etc.? The entire Quran is a journey SubhanAllah. And what is interesting from this perspective that we are going to discuss today is the very last message that is delivered when you reach the destination. Correct, there are 114 chapters in the Quran, each of them is going to take you on a journey. But what is the message given at the very end? After the Quran takes you on this magnificent journey and opens your eyes to the reality of your existence and what is beyond, the last piece of advice is what? The last piece of advice is seek refuge with your Lord, the Lord of mankind, the King of mankind, the God of mankind from the whispering of Shaitan. That's the last message delivered, correct? So, essentially, as if we're being told that after you understand this whole message of the Quran, let's give you one last piece of advice. And that is now that you have what you need, recognize that there is someone there that is trying to take that from you and that's shabbat. So, that's another angle that the scholars discuss when they talk about Surah-Anaz. And I think it's an important message for all of us as well, because isn't the proof in the pudding? What happens in Ramadan? Shilthan, the Shiaatine, they're chained. In fact, this is one of the big characteristics of Ramadan that's established by the most authentic of Hadith, that the doors of when the month of Ramadan comes, that gates of Jannah are open and the Shiaatine are chained. Once the Shiaatine are chained, you see the potential that lies within each of us. From day one, I mean, the moment that Ramadan was declared, we were busting at the seams, we couldn't even admit everybody into the muskid because there was no space. And I don't think that's unique to this building. It's occurring in every single building. They're out the world. Something changes. The moment Shiaat-an is under control. Of course, that's not the only factor. There's the blessing of the Quran of Ramadan, etc., etc., there's so many other features of Ramadan, but it's not a coincidence that when the force of Shiaat-an is curtailed, very quickly people are able to come to their senses and behave in a way that's far different than all the other 11 months of the year. And Subhanallah, the Quran is also painting that similar picture. It's reminding us that once you've captured the message of the Quran, remember that Shiaat-an is there and he is a force to be reckoned with. He is your enemy. He is out to take every single gain that you will ever achieve in your life. His only goal is to cause you to fail both in this world, but particularly in the hereafter. And he whispers, he comes, he goes, you could you will never be free of him. He arises. The moment you're born, he will be present at the moment that you're passing away. And you must seek in order to alleviate this difficulty. You must seek refuge in Allah. Subhanallah, that's how much we have to take this message to heart. I've been talking about this for four days now or how many days we started. I thought I was going to do this in an hour, keep talking about the same topic. We've been talking about this for four days. Like that's how much we have to take this message to heart. We have to appreciate that all the benefits that we have, the guidance of the Quran, in order to maintain it, to be able to express it, to be able to inculcate it. We have to recognize the counter force to that. What's the counter force to that? Of course, that's Shiaat-an. So one of the big lessons, there's many lessons that you can take from this month, but one of the big lessons of this month is simply to appreciate who the real enemy is. I know we have lots of enemies. I've talked about this as well, or what on Juma, I think. You know, we make up lots of enemies in this life, but the real enemy is Shiaat-an. And the Quran is warning us and reminding us that after you've understood all 113 chapters of this book, now of course 113th is also warning you against how to protect against visible evil, which we'll talk about later tonight, I think. But the very last message delivered should resonate. Like they say like the very end of anything resonates, and you read the end of a book, what was the last line? What was the last chapter about? When somebody's dying, what was his last words? What was the last thing he said? What was the last act that they did? What was the last play of a game or whatever it might be? So those are things that tend to stick with people and work human beings. Of course, the last message being delivered by the Quran is going to resonate with us as well. So I think that as we think about this month of Ramadan, and more specifically, as we're moving forward, as we think about how we're going to handle ourselves outside of the month of Ramadan, be very consistent, be very consistent in appreciating who the true enemy is, and in seeking refuge with Allah's panawat al-Ala against that true enemy. And again, as I mentioned, we've had a lot of academic discussions, and I don't think they're necessarily academic, because I've erased many of those points just because of the nature of this gathering. We've had a lot of perspective on the Surah, but again, what's the take home message? Like how do you know that you've captured what we've been discussing over the last few days? The way you know is that it should now be expressed in your routine. Because if you really believe, and under, if you really understand and believe in the risks that are associated with Shiahthah and his whisperings, and you really see the opportunity of only being able to seek refuge with Allah, then the mechanism of that, the final expression of that will be what? Not that I academically appreciate it or that in my head have come up with a bunch of interesting points concerning the vocabulary and the grammar and the banal of the Surah. Rather, the ultimate expression of that will be simply that you will consistently recite the Surah as a mechanism of protection. And so how will we express our understanding, which is the truest of knowledge, by the way? The truest of knowledge is that which is expressed on the limbs. How will we express our understanding by reciting these last two Surahs when, at the end of every prayer? We know that the Prophet SAW has encouraged specifically one of the companions, and through him all of us, to recite this at the end of these last two Surahs at the end of every prayer. We also know that the Prophet SAW would recite this at times of illness, particularly upon his household. We also know that the Prophet SAW would recite this in particular the last three Surahs of Lakharan at the time of going to bed. How many times it's like, you know, you almost don't have to ask yourself the question like how many times do you have to shield yourself against the same threat? If the Prophet SAW is encouraging the companions to recite this, you know, after every prayer before going to bed at times of illness, at any other time that you have fear of these types of circumstances. For example, you're in a difficult situation, you're being overcome by the whisperings you're trying to avoid a particular sin or a particular circumstance, so you recite these two Surahs. It's fairly consistent that these Surahs are recited. The Prophet SAW is consistently teaching us to shield ourselves against the one force that's out there to get us. So it's a panel of what? After 113, you know, you spend the whole Ramadan going through the Quran. Many of you are, you know, participated in listening to a recitation of the complete Quran, or I know many of you have established a goal for yourselves here of completing one, two, five, I think one brother mentioned to me, five Khatams in this gathering. Each time you hit the Khatam, you're giving the same message at the very end. You've made a journey, but at the very end of this journey before you're dropped at your destination, let's leave you with one final reminder that there is a force out there that wants to take which you gained from 113 chapters of this book, and that that force is consistently going to be attacking, and that his weapon is whispering, and he whispers into the jugular. He goes straight for the heart because the heart is what drives every human being towards their deeds. And so the only way to seek protection from this circumstance, once you appreciate the dangers of it, is to seek refuge with the Lord of mankind, the king of mankind, the god of mankind. May Allah's panelism open our eyes to the reality of our circumstances. May He make us amongst those who are able to be consistent in our expression of these surahs and to seek refuge with Allah's panelism from the evil whisperings of shaytan.
