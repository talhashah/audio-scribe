Walgreens was struggling and when they began to analyze their data, they recognized that the ones on the corner were actually doing much better than the others. So the next thing that they did was they decided that every single store has to be on a corner. و هذا كان لدينا مجدداً من المجدداً من المجدداً من المجدداً من المجدداً من المجدداً من المجدداً من المجدداً من المجدداً من المجدداً من المجدداً من المجدداً من المجدداً من المجدداً من المجدداً من المجدداً من المجدداً من المجدداً من المجدداً من المجدداً من المجدداً من المجدداً من المجدداً من المجدداً من المجدداً من المجدداً من المجدداً من المجدداً من المجدداً من المجدداً من المجدداً من المجدداً من المجدداً من المجدداً من المجدداً من المجدداً من الم المجدداً من المجدداً من المجدداً من المجدداً من المجدداً من المجدداً من المجدداً من المجدداً من المجدداً من المجدداً من المجدداً من المجدداً من المجدداً من المجدداً من المجدداً من المجدداً من المجدداً من المجدداً من المجدداً من المجدداً من المجدداً من المجدداً من المجدداً من المجدداً من المجدداً من المجدداً من المجدداً من المجدداً من المجدداً من المجدداً من المجدداً من المجدداً من المجدداً من المجدداً من المجدداً من المجدداً من المجدداً من المجدداً من المجدداً من المجدداً من المجدداً من المجدداً من المجدداً من المجدداً من المجدداً من المجدداً من المجدداً من المجدداً من المجدداً من المجدداً من المجدداً من المجدداً من المجدداً من المجدداً من المجدداً من المجدداً من المجدداً من المجدداً من المجدداً من المجدداً من المجدداً من المجدداً من المجدداً من المجدداً من المجدداً من المجدداً من المجدداً من المجدداً من المجدداً من المجدداً من المجدداً من المجدداً من المجدداً من المجددا من المجدداً من المجدداً من المجدداً من المجدداً من المجدداً من المجدداً من المجدداً من المجدداً من المجدداً من المجدداً من المجدداً من المجدداً من المجدداً من المجدداً من المجدداً من المجدداً من المجدداً من المجدداً من المجدداً من المجدداً من المجدداً من المجدداً من المجدداً من المجدداً من المجدداً من المجدداً من المجدداً من المجدداً من المجدداً من المجدداً من المجدداً من المجدداً من المجدداً من المجدداً من المجدداً من المجدداً من المجددا من المجدداً من المجدداً من المجدداً من المجدداً من المجدداً من المجدداً من المجدداً من المجدداً من المجدداً من المجدداً من المجدداً من المجدداً من المجدداً من المجدداً من المجدداً من المجدداً من المجدداً من المجدداً من المجدداً من المجدداً من المجدداً من المجدداً من المجدداً من المجدداً من المجدداً من المجدداً من المجدداً من المجدداً من المجدداً من المجدداً من المجدداً من المجدداً من المجدداً من المجدداً من المجدداً من المجدداً من المجددا ولكن.​ على فعل أن أحدprise استعادرتنا من المجدداً من المجدداً من المجدداً من المجدداً و Kollegin أيضًا، rêك Logan-Iran вперمcarbon فيقتصاástاً且 كنت آمهpesك في المجدداً من المجدداً من المجدداً في المجدداً من المجدداً من المجدداً من المجدداً من المجدداً من المجدداً ein نماية، ستنياً تلك المنطلسة التي服لك sambarness ل apex anlam Went on and we can take those principle and ask what was present in Raouloudan that made it so special and can we just borrow a little bit of that so that we can apply it to our lives today. It's a case study, just like a business school case study it's a religious case study. One of the things that's definitive about the month of Raouloudan I think even a five-year-old can quote is that it is the month in which the Shayaalthiene والسنسلة تشياء الثين هو the statement of the prophecy سنة عندما the month of Ramadan begins جياثين our chain so here we learn a really important principle which is that Shephan or in this case the شياء الثين are a major force that detract us from what we're trying to be they are made they're a major force that detract us from success in this thing and in fact even the Quran makes this evidently clear when we're told that in the Hulaqum Adhu Wum Mubin verily he is for you an outright enemy an evident outright enemy and what does it mean Shephan is an outright enemy it means that Shephan is trying to do real us from the goals that we set for ourselves which is the purpose of our existence and the ultimate success lies in the pleasure of Allah entertaining reward in the hereafter that's such a clear principle on our Dean but Shephan his complete and absolute effort is to derail us from that goal so he's an open enemy and a great blessing of Ramadan is that as soon as Ramadan comes upon us the شياء الثين are chained like I mentioned وصنسي لتشياء الثين and the شياء الثين are chained so this is one of the features of Ramadan and I would argue that because the شياء الثين are chained we're able to achieve many things that we would not normally be able to do that's one of the features of Ramadan just like I told you that the Walgreens on the corner ended up doing far more revenue than the Walgreens that were not on the corner if we want to look at the month of Ramadan and say I was certainly different than I am today one of the definitive key features of the month of Ramadan is that the شياء الثين are chained and because the شياء الثين are chained the friction the drag force the drag on us and trying to achieve our goals is significantly less and I would even argue that the plundering of shepon of our hearts and our minds and our goals is obviously restricted during the month of Ramadan now once we appreciate that that look shepon is a key enemy number one shepon is our primary enemy and number two shepon derails us from our goals by either creating friction or completely removing us from the deen or from the goals of the deen then we should appreciate that we should ask the question how can I create circumstances that will allow me to limit the effects of shepon if I was X person in Ramadan when the شياء الثين are chained and I know that that's a key feature of Ramadan what are the things that I can do once Ramadan ends to mitigate the effects of shepon there should be a key question for all of us and so panel we haven't been left alone here we don't need to philosophize about different ways by which the effects of shepon can be reduced because the props I send them gave many advices concerning shepon many advices concerning shepon and honestly you could literally do a whole week seminar on this topic but today I'm just going to share a few with the idea that number one we should appreciate that if we were able to do so much in Ramadan partly it was because of the fact that shepon was chained and number two we should appreciate that we can carry some of that into the other months by mitigating the effects of shepon in our lives so for example what are some of the ways by which we can decrease the effects of shepon one important really important feature for all of us to recognize is that we have to maintain a group we have to maintain a group the props I send them he said in the shepon Maalfev verily shepon is with the one who's alone what does that mean? it means that in fact maybe we should even say this in another narration the props I send them gave the example of how shepon is like a wolf how shepon is like a wolf and you know or at least I'm sure you've heard that the wolf attacks the sheep that's furthest from the flock like the wolf if there's a bunch of sheep the wolf doesn't attack where there's 50 sheep the wolf waits for one sheep to stray off from the flock that's the opportunity because now that sheep has lost the protection of the rest and the wolf attacks that sheep so in the same way we as human beings need to recognize that there isn't an enemy that's always out there lurking trying to derail us from our goals and that an image shepon and one of the mechanisms by which he takes advantage of us is when we're alone it's generally a good it's generally not a good thing to be alone now what does this mean more globally? it means that we have to stick with the company of people who are striving in the same way that we're striving doesn't mean that you're always with those people but it just means that in general you appreciate the need for company for example I'll just give you a simple example to pray Isha Salah is difficult if you're at home just there's just it's an odd thing to say but it's a challenge, right? you have to have willpower to pray Isha Salah when you're alone at home of course we do it but it is a challenge there is a degree of friction there that you have to overcome there's a degree of momentum that you have to overcome in order to be able to get moving and actually pray that Isha prayer but we're all sitting here right now and within 40 minutes, 50 minutes time the event for Isha will be called and it will be a really smooth ride if you happen to be sitting here now why is that? it's because we're all in an environment together I'll give you another simple example it may be it's easier to relate to if you pray Isha prayer in the masjid and you don't pray Sunnah and wither but you think in your head I'll go home and pray Sunnah and wither because there's a couple things I forgot to do the probability of praying Sunnah and wither when you get home is relatively low it's relatively low but if you say to yourself let me pray Sunnah and wither I'm not leaving here until I pray Sunnah and wither it's very likely to get done why? because again you have the benefit of the Jamaa we're all human beings we're just a bunch of sheep we're vulnerable we're vulnerable there's no negotiating that we're vulnerable we have an enemy and that enemy is trying to attack us even you can see this in the physical world I mean if you know what do they tell you at night? I tell you at the university you know we get these alerts all the time I'm at the university we get these alerts all the time beware of this crime, beware of that crime and one of the advices they always give is when you're walking outside alone at night particularly but even during the day try to walk in a group why do you try to walk in a group? because criminals identify the person who's alone and they're far easier pray than the group of five, six or 10 people that are walking together the same thing is with Shilthan so if we recognize that Shilthan is our enemy we recognize that Shilthan is derailing us from our goals and we recognize that in Ramulan when Shilthan's abilities were restricted we were able to accomplish so much then we should also appreciate the need outside of Ramulan to maintain the Jammara to maintain the greater gathering so that means that we shouldn't see ourselves it's independent we should see ourselves as part of a greater community we should link our hearts we should link our bodies we should link our presence other people who are also trying to achieve the same goals that we are and I would argue that the greatest example that is simply coming to the Master of the Prayer by coming to the Master of the Prayer you feel an energy you feel a motivation you feel less resistance to even just praying the five prayers so this is one principle what was the principle? the principle was maintain the group principle number two just as a simple example is to close the gaps what do we mean by closing the gaps? as a simple example the prophesies I mentioned that when people are praying together they should tighten up the gaps between one another now why? because if the gaps are not tight Shilthan can come in between so this is just another example when we pray together we have an etiquette in our prayer and as part of that etiquette we tighten up the gaps and when we tighten up the gaps that also mitigates the effect of Shilthan so this is another simple example by which we can restrict or limit the abilities of Shilthan a third way a third way and a really important way is recitation of the Quran recitation of the Quran provides two great benefits many many many there's many benefits in this the context of today's discussion it provides two benefits number one it attracts the angels and number two it limits the effects of Shilthan and the Shia Thin perhaps the one good example of this is that the prophesies I mentioned that the one who restricts sorry the one who resides in Bukhara the house in which Bukhara is recited house in which Bukhara is recited so the Bukhara is recited Shilthan is restricted from his the ability to influence that home so what are we learning here we're learning that the power we're we're we're we're we're getting an insight into the power of the Quran and this is why many of the scholars recommend that when a person first purchases their home they should recite Bukhara in the home for example of any of you purchase a home it's a good idea to have Bukhara recited in the home or in general it's a good thing for us to make an attempt to recite so that other Bukhara at home and what that does is that creates a certain layer of protection which protects us against Shilthan now it's not restricted to Surah Al-Bukhara only but it's just an example generally speaking the more Quran that is recited the less likely Shilthan will be able to penetrate that layer of protection so it's a very important feature of Ardine to engage in recitation of the Quran another example the prophesies I mentioned that Shilthan purges on the heart of a person this is a really interesting metaphor Shilthan purges on the heart of a person if they are mindful of Allah he's restricted but if they are unmindful of Allah then he can whisper so what does this mean? this reminds you an I number one that none of us are immune none of us are immune every one of us has a Shilthan that is perched on our hearts and we have to appreciate that that Shilthan has the ability to whisper now again you know that Shilthan doesn't have the ability to take my hand and make me do anything there's no Shilthan doesn't have that power over me all that Shilthan can do is can whisper why don't you go do this instead of this why don't you do that? so the whisperings always from Shilthan are simply meant to do real us from the most important opportunity that's before us for example Shilthan you know I have five choices before me of what to do Shilthan or whisper to me to do the one that's one less than I would have simply one less than I would have for example if I'm in the muskid and I finish the photo prayer Shilthan or Shilthan whisper in my ear you forgot the groceries you need to do this you need to do that why don't you do this? why don't you quickly go home and take care of that? it's much better to pray so not in a witter at home go ahead no I have multiple options of things in front of me but Shilthan recognizes exactly how to whisper to each person what's necessary to do real them from the next option that they would have taken that would have been good for them so every Shilthan sits on an individual's heart and he knows that individual and whispers accordingly how do we mitigate that? how do we restrict that or limit that? we restrict that or limit that by maintaining a general remembrance of a plus panowatala if we maintain a general remembrance of a law's panowatala in the heart then Shilthan's ability to whisper is highly limited but if we're not we're heedless and we're just out there and not thinking about Allah not thinking about the greater goals that we have then Shilthan can whisper and we'll whisper and whisper until eventually we end up in a place where we ourselves never thought we would be so really important to again keep a mindful heart now that's a whole nother complicated discussion about how you keep a mindful heart but in general we should be mindful of a law's panowatala and mindful of the responsibilities that we have in this life another example, maybe the last one for now another example is just a very simple beautiful analogy that the Prophet's I sent them mentioned in which he said that just as a camel tires from travel Shilthan tires from obedience again I'll repeat it just as Shilthan as I just as a camel tires from travel Shilthan tires from obedience let's go back for a second a camel is very feisty at the beginning of a journey they want to do this they want to do that they want to go here they want to go there and they have lots of energy eventually as the journey proceeds and they get worn down by the harsh terrain and the difficulties of the journey they become slow and they become actually limited in taking a person in a direction other than in which they want to guide them they become weakened essentially over time the same is true of Shilthan and what weakened Shilthan is our obedience the more we're obedient the less likely the less energy ship on has to derail us from our goals and their direction in which we want to travel so simply just maintaining some semblance of obedience by the way what's simple obedience five prayers in a day is obedience fasting them on the Ramallah is a type of a obedience planning for hug is a type of obedience giving Sallaka and then when you start adding additional pieces on that because that's the framework those are the five pillars when you start adding additional pieces to that you increase obedience at some sort of spectrum throughout throughout the day and that just simply wears down Shilthan so I mean this is a blessing right because if the more obedient we were the more he would be gain strength that would make it difficult but recognize that if a person's obedient that it actually weakened Shilthan and so fine maybe I feel like Shilthan's really on me and really creating havoc in my life but the solution to that is to simply continue with obedience because the more we're obedient the more he actually gets worn down another example it's just simply making thick of certain Ed Kaur have been taught to us and they protect us against the effects of Shilthan for example there's a famous statement of the Prophet SallAllahu Alaihi Wasallam which he would sometimes recite and the morning in the evening l'a-ilah wahtahu sana sembli Hul Hannah wa hu'a-lawala cool ni Sheehan Kushar It's a very short statement and there's many others like it and the Prophet SallAllahu Alaihi Wasallam mentioned one of the benefits of this statement is that a person is protected from Shilthan if they recite this statement in the evening they're protected from Shilthan until the morning and if they recite this statement in the morning to protect it from the evening و if they restite this statement in the morning they're protected from shephon in the evening. that doesn't necessarily mean that shephon's abilities to whisper will disappear completely because shephon is always running in the blood of every human being which is by the way another statement of the props I sent them concerning shephon that literally he runs in our blood. but what this means is that the ability of shephon becomes limited so what's the summary for today? the summary for today is very simple. that is that we should do a case study and rumble long. and by the way you could have long long lengthy discussion about this. I'm just covering one angle. you should do a case study and rumble long just like people do case studies and so many other things. every business is running a case study and which product actually works the best. you know when they release a product. for example what this restaurant wants to release a new chicken sandwich they don't release the chicken sandwich in the whole country. they release the chicken sandwich in 10 stores or let's say 20 stores or 50 stores. then they analyzed that this chicken sandwich sell well. well which topping was the best? what time of day did it sell? all these different features. I mean it's not random. it's very very organized and methodical. and then based on that they introduced the sandwich to the rest of the world. so we too we recognize that we gained so much in rumble long. rumble long was such a special time for us but rumble long is not some one month one and done month. it's a time where we appreciate we come to an understanding of what our potential is. where does our potential lie? what can we actually be? what can I actually do? all of us were uplifted by the month of rumble long. at the same time we should take lessons from that month. so what worked? right? you go back and say what worked? what didn't work? what worked? what worked? one of the things definitely that worked. that's definitive about the month of rumble long. is that the shiathin were tied up? and because the shiathin were limited, I certainly was able to accomplish so much more than I even imagined I would ever be able to do. now from that you take a case study. you say okay, what is there any way that I can mitigate the effects of shiath on outside of the month of rumble long? yes there are. there's numerous ways. staying in a group. recitation of the quran. making appropriate ethical throughout the day. maintaining a degree of obedience which tires shiathon, etc etc. quite or the summary is that shiathon is our enemy. he derails us from so many opportunities. but at the same time Allah's Qawla Allah has provided us with many ways by which we can mitigate and limit his effects. rumble long is simply an example of that. but we should carry that outside of the month of rumble long to all of the other days that exist throughout the year. may Allah's Qawla protect us from the effects of shiathon. may he keep us consistent in our deen. may he keep us in a gathering of the righteous and the pious and keep us part of the jamaah. may Allah's Qawla Allah allow us to be amongst those who are consistent in recitation of the quran. may he keep us in a state of his remembrance such that the shiathon that is purchased on our hearts is not whispered into our ears. may he allow us to remember the various doa and atgar throughout the day that protect us against shiathon. may he allow us to maintain obedience which wears down shiathon. wa al-khirat alana anil hamdulillahirrahmanirrahimin.
