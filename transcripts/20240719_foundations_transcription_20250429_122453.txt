رب الالمين الله وسلمcios عن السيدنا محمد، وعلى آل ingredients علىbreviام وبرك وسلم مهمة والعالة وليسينه دينه مهمة وبادك وسنلم أمدر الله each month we get the opportunity to meet for the gems of the Quran program and in that program we cover I think most of you probably attend that program we get the opportunity to cover some of the ayat of the Holy Quran from the 30th juz و we just had the program last weekend if I recall correctly و in that program we spoke about Surah Al-Alaq so Pana'la you know we get together and I think that Surah must have taken us two sessions we did it a month ago and then we kind of repeated a little bit and completed the Surah this past weekend و so I think we probably spoke for close to two hours on the topic but there's so many interesting things that our scholars say that you can never exhaust even the depth that's present in just a single verse of the Quran and one of the things that I picked up on as I was preparing for that I didn't get to expound on during the program so I wanted to spend a few minutes today just expounding on this principle but before I can highlight that principle I'm going to just go back a little bit lay down a foundation and then in inshallah we'll build up and you'll see how everything will fit together in a minute so let me just start by saying that generally the first like they say you know they say this in our society the first impression really matters or another way to put it would be that for example you know that when you read a book for example let's just say any famous novel let's say you take the hundred most famous novel novels of a written and you pick them up for the most part you're going to find that the first sentence is very famous and an author in general when they write a text they're very particular about the first sentence the first sentence really needs to be something that's definitional needs to define the work it needs to catch the attention's reader and because again it's the same thing which is what we just spoke about the first impression is a is a lasting impression so you open a book and you read the first line and you're like whoa that's a really really deep statement it takes you just on the beginning of a journey and if you meet a person for the first time and they impress you you remember that person you really remember that person for example I can tell you when you're reviewing an application I review applications for medical students and residents all the time and when I review the application and very quickly in ten seconds I can tell the first I look at the first few things I know what to look at I look at the first few things and it doesn't mean I can define a person in ten seconds of course nobody can you're bringing their whole life's accomplishments and putting it in an application but what I mean to say here is that in a few minutes maybe seconds to minutes I can quickly get an impression of that person so first impressions they are often lasting and first impressions are often relevant now the reason I mention all of this is because as you're aware if you were here last weekend we spoke about Surah Al-Alaq and this Surah actually has the first five verses revealed to the Prophet Sahih Salam that was something that we we really spent some time talking about and maybe I can even be more direct here in particular in those first five Surah first five ayat the key message being delivered is recitation and as you all know the first verse Iqarah Bismi-Rabbi Khalilati Khalaq read or recite in the name of your Lord who created Khalaq Al-Insan bin Alak created man from a clot Iqarah again read or recite what up Bukal Akram and your Lord is most generous now this is just the first three verses but notice that the emphasis here the emphasis is on recitation in fact what's interesting is that in the first five verses of the Quran which were revealed to the Prophet Sahih Salam to essentially crown him as a messenger and begin the deliverance of the Quran from the heavens to the heart of the Prophet Sahih Salam of course it's going to take 23 years but these first five verses the command to recite comes twice Iqarah it's twice it's the first word or the first verse and it's the first word of the third verse and one of the messages that we can take from this that the scholars mention it's just how important it is for us to recite now often when you when you read the translation or even you read an explanation of these verses lots of emphasis is presented on this notion of reading so lots of people will say see this means you need to be educated see this means that advancement occurs through reading and education this is highlighting the importance of knowledge all of those are true but foundationally the verse the command of the verse is being given to recite revelation Revelation is of course different than anything that human beings can ever produce right human beings are unlimited they they're simply the canama of nes a canama of people but the word of Allah's panamatullah cannot be compared to the words of people so I agree education can be beneficial but the point here is that the command is being given to recite revelation to the prophesies of them and of course once a person engages in revelation then that is going to drive them to become a productive member of society to educate themselves and to do what's necessary to maintain excellence and what they do so all of those are going to be secondary but the primary command here very important to note the primary command is for recitation of revelation now taking this one step further it's a reminder to you and I that the foundation right because this is the foundational interaction with the miracle of the Quran the miracle of this Dean is the Quran and the foundational interaction of the prophesies and them and subsequently through him of all of us is with revelation this is the first command to recite the revelation and the message that we have to take is it not some historical story that we're telling that happened 1400 years ago there was a man in a cave so I sent him he was in the prophesies and was in the cave and we're being told that he was told the recite revelation we're not learning this circuit we're not reviewing this circumstance to talk about history we're talking about this circumstance to bring relevance into our lives so what's the relevant point here the relevant point is that this Dean is built and predicated upon an engagement with revelation and this is the challenge that we all face to recognize that there's lots of opportunities to engage with things in the world I can engage with Star Wars I can engage with the NBA I can engage with my physics class I can engage with a medical textbook or a medical journal or a scientific journal these are all present no doubt we have options to engage with many things but the ultimate opportunity and the foundation of what will allow us to become who we want to be is only going to occur through revelation and there's no negotiating this point there's no negotiating this point if you come to me and say you know I feel like making a stick far I prefer a stick far I don't like to make as much salawat okay you can have some room there I prefer to make this the good instead of that you can have some room there I prefer to study thick instead of the to see it there's some room there right I prefer to give charity instead of standing in the middle of the night and offering prayer there's some room to discuss there but there's no room for this discussion this Dean is predicated upon engagement with the Quran it is the main meal everything else aside from what's been assigned to us are the condiments there's no discussion here there's no discussion here what that means is that any person the first message first message were being to you know you're going to start you let's just say there's something that starts with five lines okay the fact that the command to recite is repeated twice is almost like redundancy within the five lines you would think give five unique commands why you're just giving one key command that's highlighting the importance of the message of recitation so all of us in this room have to recognize that we have to recognize that if we really want to become who we want to become personally then we have to have a schedule of recitation there has to be a schedule a routine of recitation in our lives it can't be that the crown sits on our shelves and we just pick it up on occasion and see what interesting thing we find when we think we have a need no we're in constant need of it it's the food of our souls just like you would not go if I said to you, hey has anybody in this if I said to you, you know, are you going to have dinner tonight? what do you mean? I have dinner every night I have dinner every night okay, or did you eat something today? yes, I eat every day let's make it more general I eat every day but if I were to actually you know, call on people and say well did you engage the Quran on Tuesday? many many people would say Tuesday? not sure so that's not acceptable for the person who wants to build the foundations of their dean and this is the first question that we all need to ask ourselves what is my schedule with the Quran? what is my schedule with the Quran? often I say often in this gathering in particular that look every person who's serious about their spiritual development needs to have 20 minutes of Quran every day needs to have 20 minutes of Quran every day why? number one, it's the miracle of the dean it's the miracle of the dean when we engage with the word of Allah's panellat ala we take a piece of that miracle into our hearts it elevates us, it purifies us, it guides us it is the greatest opportunity that we have number one not that this is some sort of all-inclusive list but just these are off the top of my head because I'm speaking here off the top of my head number one, number two you can't approach Allah's panellat ala with anything better than what came from him I'm just paraphrasing Hadith here from Tidmithy you cannot approach Allah's panellat ala with anything better than what came from him any of the Quran meaning that if you have any desire of we if any desire to approach Allah's panellat ala it's going to be through the Quran not through some made up paradigm that I created some curriculum or some list of Ethkat or some sort of list of deeds that you perform there's no exception it doesn't matter who you are you could be Mr. political activist you could be Mrs. scholar every person whatever their expertise may be is still required to develop a foundational relationship with the Quran this is Muslim defining so this is number two we can't approach Allah's panellat ala with anything better than what came from him I.e. here the Quran number three the the father the father the superiority the superiority of the word of Allah over the superiority of anything other than the word of Allah any that can I'm a nest the can I'm of the people right the superior to superiority of Allah's word over the word of people is like the superior to superiority of Allah over creation would any of you in this room ever dare compare Allah's panellat ala creation never never would we ever dare to compare Allah's panellat or the creation these things are incomparable there's nothing that's similar nothing similar between them yet how dare we compare the word of Allah against the word of humanity the word of people the word of people means the talking heads the entertainment even the education you cannot compare that to the Quran yet I'm not saying we do it by mouth or tongue we would never do it by mouth or tongue but maybe perhaps our behavior is that way maybe in our behavior we give so much emphasis to the news the podcasts Tiktok Instagram all these things that we spend our time on every one of us is different we all have our own you know addictions but how could it be that like if I were to like you know you know if I were just look back at my last 24 hours just look it back at my last 24 hours and say okay in the last 24 hours how much did I engage the word of people the talking of the people and how much did I engage the word of Allah and if it's like the word of Allah you know a few minutes here maybe and the word of people is like dominant then I'm going to be influenced by the word of people and the word of people is just as empty as the people themselves not I'm not saying people are empty but you understand that people are passing so where will that leave us where will that leave us this is foundational and like I said earlier it doesn't matter your ability it's not about how much you recite it's not about how much we recite it's not about how much progress we make it's simply about appreciating that this is the word of Allah and that this is very very special to me honestly even if there was a person who just doesn't know how to recite or read anything but just look at the Quran and says I know that this is superior to everything also around me they take benefit from it in fact just taking that one step further the prophet says on them said that you know the one who recites fluently is in the presence of the angel and the one who recites with difficulty gets a double the reward that means the one who's kind of like scraping by and putting letters and words together is getting double the reward of the one who recites fluently why? because they're making the effort recognizing that this is the word of Allah and this is something I will never give up on that's the power of the opportunity so the first message which I unfortunately didn't get to harp on over the last gathering the first message for I have everybody here myself beginning with myself that we should appreciate that we're serious about developing our Dean we're serious about bringing light into our homes we're serious about elevating our spirits we're serious about developing ourselves as an ummah in the future and solving so many of the problems that we face it cannot occur without a consistent relationship with the Quran it cannot occur without a consistent relationship with the Quran this is the miracle of the Dean this is what uplifted us and this is what is our downfall this is what is our downfall now let's go one step further because I actually said the point I actually want to make I haven't gotten to yet the point that the scholars make is very nuanced so I'm setting up the stage because I'm trying to deliver a point and again I'm not doing a good job because it's off the top of my head but now let's get to the next point which is the point I just kind of touched on which is that to leave the Quran will lead us to a place where we never imagined we would end up on the global scale historically and in our time it's when we disconnect our souls from the Quran that we lose so many of the blessings that were present and right before us and you don't have to look further than what's going on in the world around us now I know I'm not naive I'm an educated person I recognize that you know you can't directly attribute our state to the Quran meaning you can't say because of this this is happening but I will just tell you that if you have a wide lens you can start with yourself we can start with ourselves and we can ask the question am I experiencing the deen the way that I should experience it and if not it's very likely that we just haven't engaged the Quran by engaging the Quran I don't mean some academic study I mean taking it as a taking it as a source of spiritual nourishment academic study comes with that but we want to make everything academic nowadays just become one more class I'm not talking about that I'm talking about a deep engagement with the Quran the way the Sahaba engaged the Quran alright so number one in our own lives if we see that there are deficiencies in our character we see that the light that that is present in our deen isn't shining brightly in our hearts we see that the energy is lacking we see that our families are in disarray we see that our communities are breaking down we see that people are you know, Mala protect us leaving the deen part of it a big part of it is because we haven't brought the Quran to life the way that it should be brought to life within ourselves within our homes within our greater community again it's not the only issue I mean a person who recites the Quran has to do the hard work of changing their character asking how they can improve all of the things that come with that but the Quran is is the foundation that Quran is the foundation of this deen and if we disconnect ourselves from it we end up in a place that we didn't imagine even though our minds wish we were someplace else you understand point number two that's still not my point now I'm going to come to my point point number three not my point the point that the scholars make point number three and point number three is a case in point what does a case in point mean it means an example to highlight the principle that I'm discussing here and point number three is a gun going to take you back a step and I'm going to say that remember what I started with which as I said that the first interaction is often a defining one the first interaction is often a defining one so the first interaction of this ummah was Ikrach recite Ikrach recite the divine revelation so this was the first interaction and if we leave that first interaction we will slow our compass will slowly get off course and we will end up in a place where we shouldn't be correct now the point that I'm trying to make is that this example is beautifully highlighted in another place in the Quran and this is the nuanced point that I was trying to get to and Savannah La the way the scholars explain this honestly I've been thinking about it for one week normally when I finish the series and so when I finish the gems program I just go and I flush my mind of everything when I get home because I have so much time preparing this that my head is completely wrapped around everything so normally I just disappear and move on in fact I can tell you that when I do the next program I never remember where I left off I have to ask somebody which I had to leave off on because I just completely like just to just to reset myself I just forget but finally this last whole week I keep thinking about this point and I didn't even make it in the gathering but I keep thinking about this point and just how deep it is so the point that I now that we're trying to get to is that the first interaction is definition is definitional it's foundational and a lack of that a lack of appreciation of that takes you to a place where you never imagined you would be and another example of this is present in the Holy Quran and what's that example okay now to understand that example I have to also take you back one so you can see why we didn't do this last week we would have spent the whole time but let me just remind you let's go back it's the this example that we're pointing out is actually another verse in the Quran which is actually arising in another incident that occurred centuries before the prophet's life centuries before the prophet's life and what is that it is the miraculous birth of Issa Ali his Sinab the miraculous birth of Issa Ali his Sinab of course is Jesus he's be upon him okay so what's the circumstance as you're all aware his mother Ali has Sinab she was given the blessing of a child without ever having interacted with another man and this was one of the miracles of this was a miracle correct now when she was giving birth she was commanded to separate herself from the community and to give birth and narrates this in detail but we don't have time so she is commanded to separate herself and she gives birth and once she gives birth she's fearing what her community will think when she shows up with the child now of course because they're not going to appreciate immediately appreciate the miraculous nature of the incident they're going to come to conclusions which are extreme what would the extreme conclusion be that somehow some sort of like elicit relationship may look protect us from ever thinking this some elicit relationship occurred so that's going to be their natural conclusion because they're not seeing it as a miracle they're seeing it based on the common understanding of the world around them so as she approaches her community with the child in her arms interestingly she is commanded by Allah's panawatullah to fast so she fast and she fast and by the way the fasting at that time included fasting from speech so she cannot speak now this is kind of an interesting situation if you think about it because she's going to approach her community with a child in her arms the community is going to make conclusion A which is a very very very very you know a difficult conclusion to come to and her only defense would have been what she can't show the baby her only defense would be to speak that's the one defense she has to say you know you know me I would never do such a thing this is a miracle from Allah this is the way by which she can defend herself but Subhanallah she's commanded to fast so she can't speak so she doesn't have that defense so when she shows up with the baby in hand and she cannot defend herself she has to point to the baby and the first interaction with the community occurs in which he's the baby speaks this is a miracle of Isha Ali As-Salam he speaks he says inni Abdallah and that's the introductory interaction under the foundational interaction of the people of Isha Ali As-Salam with Isha Ali As-Salam okay now Subhanallah it's interesting the first interaction essentially this is a revelation because it's a verse of the Quran inni Abdallah the first interaction that the community of Isha Ali As-Salam has with the revelation and with this miracle the foundational interaction is what is to recognize that Isha Ali As-Salam is the servant of Allah is to recognize that Isha Ali As-Salam is the servant of Allah this is their foundational challenge because it's their first impression it's their first interaction and Subhanallah you can see when they mistook this point where did they end up today isn't this the issue? instead of recognizing him as Abdallah they are attributing or associating him with Allah so the lack of their ability to take that foundational message led them to end up in a place far from the original message you understand and I think everybody in this room can relate to that they would say wow it started here and it ended up here so the scholars are saying that if this is the historical case in point of a community that fails to appreciate their foundational message and they end up centuries later far from that message in the same way if this community fails to appreciate its case in point foundational message recitation of revelation they will also potentially end up far from where they think they should have been you understand the point that they're making now it took me half an hour to highlight this because it's so subtle by the way they say in one sentence it's funny because I read the sentence and then and then I just glossed over it and I didn't get it I didn't get it and then a few days later I just came back in my head well what was that? like I didn't understand that and it took me just a little a little bit to catch on although it was set in such a it was set in passing it wasn't like a developed argument over you know pages it was just a sentence and it's a lot but the depth and it just kept ringing in my mind for the whole week the depth here of the reminder is like essentially what were the reminder the sentence is trying to make is that look if you think that if you see the people of today the people of Isha'a Alayhi Sallam today the community of Isha'a Alayhi Sallam today and where they are compared to where they started and you want to know how they got there it's because they lost their foundational introduction their basic principle of this this message that was the first message delivered to them and in the same way if we don't hold fast to recitation of revelation we will very easily end up far from the direction that we should be headed in and I think that's Kaisen Point today Kaisen Point today now Subhanallah it's built into our dean that we engage the revelation right because we've got to pray five times a day and the prayer inherently contains revelation so we're somewhat insulated we can say the community is insulated because as long as you're praying five times a day you're going to engage revelation but that type of appreciation of the revelation and engaging it recognizing that Allah is the creator of everything and this is an opportunity to be able to engage with His words and recognizing that Allah Subhanallah is Echukham He's Echukham the most generous and the most noble and this is an opportunity to be able to engage with His words and to appreciate that this is better than anything else that everything is created all of this stuff that we pursue and all of these things that we talk up between one another and all of these circumstances that we think are so important in our lives these are all things that regenerate in our own mind they're not the real opportunity the real opportunity is an engagement with the Quran so every one of us on so many levels on a personal level every one of us needs to hold fast to the Quran otherwise we will end up in a place where we never imagined we would be and on a family level the whole family the household, let's not say family the household needs to be built around the Quran just like if I ask you I'm certain everybody in this room goes to the grocery store there's no way you can't go to the grocery store the human body needs to be fed but the soul is the same the soul is the same somebody in the house has to be bringing in the groceries so somebody in the house better be reciting some Quran in the home in order to bring Baraka into the entire home and I'm not saying we should be reciting it as some sort of litany we should be reciting it because it's the word of Allah not because like it's giving me some benefit of protecting me in my home yes we get that benefit but we're reciting it because it's the word of Allah the benefit comes with it the benefit comes with it so somebody in the home or at least one, two, three people the household there should be some engagement with the Quran and then on a community level like a community level that on a community level there should be some gatherings that are established that allow us to be able to engage the Quran be reminded of the importance of the Quran and then on a broader level just the importance of emphasizing the Quran within the Ummah as a whole so this is the miracle of our our theme this is the opportunity that all of us have and I would just say you know just a simple take home message is that look ten, fifteen minutes a day it's just not a big deal ten, fifteen minutes a day to just say okay honestly if you just said to yourself you know my journey in the Quran is going to begin with my learning how to pronounce each letter properly and so what I'm going to do is that I'm just going to spend five minutes or seven minutes every day learning one letter I know you know the letters but just practicing it to pronounce it properly within a month you would have completed all the letters within a month you would have completed all the letters you say a month you would a month just passed I mean we met for a gems program a month before and then a month before that and a month before that and you know that tomorrow is going to be the next from what I'm it just comes like that so to have simple simple goals and then to build upon them and then to create this engagement with the Quran that opens up the taste of the Quran and when you open up the taste of the Quran then it becomes like anything else you don't need to be told to go entertain we don't need to be told to entertain ourselves we're like asking when is the next episode coming when is the next book coming you know when is the next whatever season coming whatever person is interested in it's because they tied their heart to it so just a reminder I think from the from the last gathering what I'll say is that just a reminder a beautiful depth of the scholars but just a reminder of the importance of understanding the blessing of revelation for us and the importance of having a consistent interaction with it if we're serious about developing ourselves spiritually Mellus Panadhala make us amongst those who are able to appreciate the opportunities that he provides for us in particular the opportunity to engage the Quran Mellus Panadhala grant us the ability to be able to engage it on a consistent basis Mellus Panadhala make it that which is the most enjoyable means of passing our time Mellus Panadhala open its depths to our hearts and may he make a resource of guidance for us in both this world and the next Wa'ahh-e-Rata'wana an'il hamdallillahi r-bada'alamin
