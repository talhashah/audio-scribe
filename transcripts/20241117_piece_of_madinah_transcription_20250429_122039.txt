Every one of us wishes that we could be a part of Medina. I mean I think if you know any true believer if you were to say you know what would be your dream in this world obviously the dream in the hair after would be go to go straight to Jannah but what would be your dream in this world if you could be any place at any time in any circumstance for example if you had a time machine where would you be? and I think there's no even space to think all of us would say that we wish we could be in Medina at the time of the Prophet's al-Azzaanham and that would be perhaps the most amazing experience to be able to sit with the Prophet's al-Azzaanham to sit with the companions to be able to experience the Dean in the way that they experienced the Dean to be able to serve the Dean in the way in which they serve the Dean such that you would be laying down foundations that would last for centuries. There'd be there'd be no better opportunity. It's upon Allah Allah has not chosen us for that probably due to our own weakness if we were there who knows what we would have done and how consistent we would have been but still I think we can all appreciate that yearning that we wish we could be part of Medina. When you think about Medina it's important to remember that it didn't just arise and evacuate. It wasn't just some sort of spontaneous situation or circumstance that arose that all of a sudden just randomly a Medina became a Medina. Rather there were foundations or pieces that were laid in order for Medina to eventually become Medina. And one of those is what we're going to discuss today. I'm going to give you a little background just to make it interesting and then shall we head into the discussion. So I think many of you attend that the Seer Program that we do or the Gems of the Quran Program that we do once a month. And perhaps you know I've covered this too many times but we always talk about at the beginning of every Surah we always talk about whether the Surah is Makki or Medina. And I always say and I can repeat here again today that when you think about a Surah when the scholars I should say rather when they classify a Surah one of the ways of classifying a Surah actually it applies to verses but in the case of the 30th just you're dealing mostly with Surahs is whether this Surah or verse is Makki or Medina. And all of you know that this division is predicated upon the Hijrah. Those verses that were revealed before the Hijrah they're referred to as Makki or Makia and those verses that were revealed after the Hijrah are referred to as Medina. So this over and over again. Now once you have that classification in mind if you were a student and you weren't thinking typical maybe high school student or college student might say wait a minute. So you have this group of Surahs that's revealed before the Hijrah we call those Makki. You have a group of Surahs that were revealed after the Hijrah we call those Medina but is there anything in between? You understand what I'm saying there was a Hijrah did not occur in an instant it occurred over a span of time. So what about verses that were revealed during the Hijrah? Where did those fall? And it's interesting the scholars they actually discuss this because the conversation or this question actually arises in the case of Wa'ilul lillmultafifin al-Multafifin is the Surah and begins Wa'ilul lillmultafifin woe be to the ones who short-change or defraud. And the conversation there is that some of the scholars are the opinion. Now of course there's often multiple opinions in these types of matters but many of the scholars are of the opinion that this Surah was actually revealed during the Hijrah. So it's like a trivia question actually you know these Surahs are Makki these Surahs are Medina which one was actually revealed in between. So some of the scholars are of the opinion that this Surah was actually revealed during the Hijrah. And they say that the reason this was revealed in particular was because one of the situations present in Medina prior to the arrival of the Prophet Sahib Senna was that the merchants of Medina would often short-change. The merchants of Medina would often short-change and what type of short-changing are we referring to? I mean the Surah defines Wa'ilul lillmultafifin alladheena idaqtaaluh alladheena idaqtaaluh alannasi astaufoon those who when they seek what's due to them they want they demand their full measure wa'ilha qaaluhum al-wazanuhum yukhsirun but when they waive for others or when they measure for others they short-change. So essentially the way you want to imagine this what was happening or according to these scholars what was happening in Medina at the time was that the merchants when it came to demanding their right they would take the full right meaning when it comes to demanding what you're supposed to pay me I want the full payment but when it comes to giving you what you're supposed to receive I give less and typical in the scales right so when it comes to the scales maybe I short-change on the scales and don't give the full weight of what is due to the person so these are the short-changers the motafifin and the Quran is warning them wa'ilul lillmultafifin anyway the scholars they say that in Medina the merchants of Medina this was prevalent among the merchants of Medina that they would take more and give less which is a type of short changing now this Surah was then revealed in this context the Surah was then revealed to warn the merchants of Medina that such transactions are discordant with the coming of the messenger the ultimate formation of Medina you understand you are you're about to receive the greatest gift on earth which is that Medina is about to become Medina the prophesy sent them is moving from Makkah to Medina to establish this bastion of Islam which is going to form the foundation for all of humanity so this type of behavior needs to be eradicated before the coming of the prophesy sent them meaning that it's not appropriate for a city or a place to be transacting in this way because if the city or place is transacting in this way the arrival of the prophesy sent them is discordant with that these two things are like water and oil they don't mix you can't bring the purity of Islam and the beauty of the prophesy sent them into a circumstance where fraud is occurring where where there's short changing where people demand their full due but they give less than what they should be giving to others now that according to the scholars as we've mentioned this Surah was that would then have been revealed during the Hijr so it would be neither technically Makkah nor technically Medina rather it's the Surah that was reminding the people of Medina of the importance of their behavior in order to lay the foundations for the coming of the prophesy sent them so what can we gain from this why is this an important conversation I have today are we just having some sort of like historical academic talk upon you know which some trivia question which Surah was revealed during the Hijr the reason for us to recognize this is because like I started at the very beginning every one of us wishes that we could be in Medina or that we would have been in Medina that we would have had the opportunity to participate the way the great companions of the past participated may Allah be pleased with them now of course we weren't chosen for that and there's a wisdom in that but the point still remains that if we couldn't present ourselves in Medina at least we could create the circumstances such that we can take a piece of Medina with us and I don't mean physically you know you go to Medina you take a good prayer rug from Medina which is typical which is fine what I'm talking about here is that the spiritual reality of Medina every one of us still has that opportunity to be able to take a piece of that with us Medina is essentially the name of a place where this service of Islam was generated correct I mean the ultimate sacrifices were made by the Sahaba in order to render themselves worthy of the service of Islam and this is what we want to take in the end we want all the blessings associated with it but we want to be able to another way otherwise stated we want a Allah's power to use us for his Dean if I would argue it this way if we can't if we couldn't have been present in Medina then the next best thing would be to carry the mission of Medina which is alive and vibrant till the end of time and the mission of Medina is what that we not be among those who simply take but rather we be among those who when they take they also reciprocate and they give that's the that's that's the people who carry the mission of Medina so taking is there no question in our minds that the Sahaba took from the prophesy I said them to the end degree that's what made them Sahaba by the way correct that's what makes them who they were it wasn't that they were taking from each other they took from the prophesy I said them so they when the prophesy I said them was present with them they faced him yet when the need arose to reciprocate that and to deliver that blessing to all of humanity whoever they were going to engage with they with equal fervor maybe even with a greater fervor in some ways turned and served the rest of humanity that's what makes the Sahaba the Sahaba meaning they didn't just have their hearts ignited they turned around and they took that candle and ignited the hearts of the people that they touched this is the you can say this is the essence of Medina and again like I said sure we weren't present there it would be a dream it would be a dream come true we would certainly not be deserving of Allah's Allah has chosen us for that there's a wisdom we're not there we're here but like I said the mission of Medina remains an opportunity for all of us if we're ready to carry it however before we can even think about gaining the benefits of Medina let alone turning around and eventually serving the way that the people of Medina served we have to ensure that the foundations that allowed this reaction to occur that that same milieu environment that all that is controlled if you're talking like a chemical reaction right the same environment has to be present the same controls have to be present and so this message that was delivered to the inhabitants of Medina prior to the coming of the prophesy send them becomes essential for us to inculcate as well which is what which is that look if you people are going to become the people of Medina then you need to appreciate one that like fraud is absolutely discordant with the taking of the it can never be that you defraud others but that message actually goes one layer further which is what which is what the a person who hears this warning how are they going to react they're going to react by saying not only will I never defraud another but I will always be the one that gives extra to ensure that I never defraud another you understand and that's the power of the Quran because it took the people of Medina who let's say a subset of them had this habit of being a fraudulent in their transactions and it flipped the whole thing on their head on its head such that the question of fraud or short-changing didn't exist rather they became people who gave everything for the sake of Islam right i mean you go from one extreme to another one extreme is you take take take take take and you give back very little or you don't give back your full dupe the opposite extreme would be that you take but then you give even more than what you took that's the attitude that was established in the people of Medina which allowed them to eventually become the companions that they to become the companions that the eventually would become and that's the attitude that has to be present and all of us now the scholars they say that this whole notion of short-changing true it was revealed in the context of business transactions so its foundations lie in every business transaction but it actually is applicable to every transaction what do you mean every transaction well every time two human beings interact they're transacting for example if two people or two neighbors are interacting there's a transaction that's occurring that that that transactions predicated on them being neighbors but there's a transaction that's occur every time a child interacts with their parent a transaction is occurring in a way every time two friends interact a transaction is occurring every time you sit in a muster then the Imam is giving a hutbah a transaction is occurring and the wise one or let's say this way the one who seeks to take the piece of Medina with them albeit physically I understand we're not there but who takes wants to take a metaphysical piece of Medina with them they have to appreciate that fraud can never exist in a transaction but even more so they need to view every transaction as an opportunity to not take but rather to give because that was what defined the companions that made Medina Medina and this is the question that we have to ask ourselves now you'll see invariably it's easy in the things that are easy I think we as human beings we recognize we should always give a little more so it's always easy to give a little more in the easy things but that's not where the challenge lies because like I said many times before look if you go out into the world and everybody's a little generous and you then a little generous as well that's not a snap that's just reciprocation I mean any any person on the planet they don't need like some deep cognizance of Allah's panellatah and some deen to guide them that you know if somebody treats me well I should treat them well that's pretty obvious where does the challenge lie the challenge lies when apparently we're not getting what we think we do but yet instead irrespective we go one degree further and give what we should be giving that's where the challenge lies so this is the question that we should be asking ourselves we should be asking ourselves number one in any transaction in which I'm partaking am I giving my full due for example this is give you a simple example Allah's panellatah blesses every one of us with youth some of it it's we're in the middle of our youth for some of it maybe for some of us maybe it's a memory now the question is when we take that youth do we take that youth for ourselves as part of that transaction or do we turn around and appreciating that Allah has blessed us with this youth do we use it in order to do everything in our power to advance the mission of this deen same with our health Allah's panellatah transacts with us and gives us health now the question is in the context of that health do I turn around and use every heartbeat every breath every molecule of ATP that I'm burning do I turn around and use that for the sake of the deen or do I use it for myself to entertain myself to play games with myself to keep myself occupied with whatever whims and desires I have same with our wealth it's a transaction Allah's panellatah bestows me with x amount of wealth now the question is what do I do with that wealth do I appreciate that I have received this as a gift and as a bounty and do I then turn around and expend it for the sake of deen or do I just dilute myself into thinking that this is mine and that somehow I'm the one that actually provided it to myself and do I go on and just spend it on myself and my whims and on my desires all of this is a type of transaction and subhanallah sahaba became sahaba because they faced the prophet's ayah send them took what he was teaching took from his words took from his actions took from the reality of his heart took from the verses of the Quran but they turned and then delivered that in every way shape in every way shape and form possible that's the type of transaction that makes Medina Medina and that's the question that we should ask ourselves that's where that that is what allows us to take that piece that we weren't given the opportunity to take and by the way this is just the reality of our existence everyone's going to pass all of the things that we thought important are going to be proven to be absolutely irrelevant to reality and we'll be just left with a few pieces of reality and what is that going to be it's going to be our time and how we spent it it's going to be our health and how we appropriated it it's going to be our wealth and what we used it how we used it these are the simple questions like all of us I think you know some kid in Islam knows these questions you know my time and how I used it my health and where I appropriated it my wealth and how I spent it these are the questions that we're going to be asked because that's the transaction that we're involved in so the other the other point to recognize here and I was going on this I got to put off on this tangent for a second is that in our lives there'll be lots of transactions that are easy to reciprocate but there are some that are going to be difficult and that's where the challenge lies for example maybe all my interactions are perfect except my interaction with my cousin maybe all my interactions are decent except my interaction with my spouse maybe all my interactions are decent except my interactions with my boss at work I don't know there's always someone there's always some situation that's a challenge that's a trial that's a test that's a tribulation again same principle applies the challenges and how we behave with the people that treat us well the challenges how we behave with the people who apparently don't fulfill our rights Clay and Merlotte Panwattala allow us to be able to appreciate the reality of the transactions that we engage in may he make us amongst those who take benefit from all of the opportunities that are present around us and may he make us amongst those and use that in the service of Dean
