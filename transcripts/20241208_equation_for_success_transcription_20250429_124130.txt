 الحمد لله وكفا والسلام على إباده الذين اصطفى اما بعد فأوض بالله من شيطان الوجيم اسم الله الرحمن الرحيم والذين جاهدوا فينا لنحدي انهم سبولنا سبحان ربك رب للزة اما يصفون والسلام على المرسلين والحن لله رب العالمين الله مسلل على سيدنا محمد وعلى آل سيدنا محمد وبرك وسلم كل one of us has goals that we are trying to achieve and it is important to recognize that there are sort of two steps in achieving a goal the first is very straightforward it is just an idea that I want to achieve this thing maybe it is not so straightforward if you are talking about people who don't appreciate the need for something but let's just say for example that a person wants to become a lawyer before a person can become a lawyer they have to appreciate a need or a desire to become a lawyer they have to be inspired towards that goal and the second step in attaining a goal is to recognize that in order to achieve that goal I need to be in a certain environment so there are two things why don't we say there are two things to achieve a goal, inspiration and environment that is really important for us to appreciate because the dean inspires us towards certain goals but we have to remember that as we are inspired towards those goals the environment is going to be essential to achieve those goals now there are two dimensions here the first is where we take our inspiration from easy for everybody in the room here we take our inspiration from dean and the more we engage with the Qur'an and the more we engage with the Sunnah and the Syirah the more we become inspired towards the goals of the dean and that is very positive and that is something that we are all encouraged to do but that is not the end that is the beginning that is not the end it is the beginning meaning that for example if I go for Al-Mura, I go for Hajj, I engage the month of Ramadan I am going to be inspired towards many things and perhaps I can make a list of those things but that is not the goal in and of itself that is just a reminder of what I am being inspired towards the next step always is to place myself in an environment that is going to allow me to be able to achieve that goal and this is where I think often we fail so for example I think all of us are inspired to engage the Qur'an and what Muslim would not be inspired to engage the Qur'an we recognize the opportunity that the Qur'an provides us we recognize the importance of reciting it properly we recognize the benefit of understanding its words we recognize that it uplifts our souls and that it guides us both in this world and towards success in the hereafter so this is an inspiration that arises in us but again it is not enough to just be inspired the inspiration leads to an intention and a lot of rewards and tensions but at the same time we have to recognize that to achieve that goal we have to put ourselves into certain environments I can tell you that lots of people come to me and will tell me that you know I wanted to memorize Qur'an or I want to learn the meanings of Qur'an or I want to improve my recitation of Qur'an but if you meet them two, three, five years later nothing's changed in fact I would argue that actually the only thing that's changed is that the inspiration that they had five years ago is actually dissipated and they're not as inspired but once in a while someone will actually come to me and say you know I want to learn the Qur'an and I'll meet them a couple years later and they'll tell me a story about how they achieved so much over the last couple of years and invariably the reason when you go back and dig into it invariably the reason that they were able to achieve whatever they achieved over the past few years is because they plugged themselves into some sort of environment for example they'll tell me that well there's a local teacher who's teaching Qur'an and I started just joining their circles every day after Fajr and all of a sudden you know one day became two, two became four, four became eight and all of a sudden I achieved this lofty, lofty, and so on I achieved this lofty goal which I never imagined that I would have memorized I don't know 26, 27, 28 just as an example and again the key differentiating factor between the people who say they want to do something but don't really do it versus the people that wish they could do something and eventually achieve it in my mind is often almost always environment so this is something that again is important for us look we come into circumstances and circles that inspire us we sit with one another, we come into the muskid, we have a talk, we're inspired towards something a talk doesn't do anything just because I give a talk or you give a talk it's not going to make me achieve a goal it's going to inspire me towards a goal, you have to appreciate that because in this day and age we see the talk as sort of the end all the talk is a mechanism of inspiration, it doesn't bring forth or doesn't cause the goal to arise it simply inspires towards a goal so I go for Omra, I get inspired towards something I sit in the company of let's say I go to a graduation you go to a graduation where a bunch of kids who have memorized Quran are being certified and they're either getting any Jeze and they're Quran that is going to inspire me towards something each of these types of engagements are highly beneficial sure we should all of us should put ourselves in those environments but remember what's the benefit of that environment? the benefit of that environment is that I get inspired towards something and once I get inspired towards that thing then the next thing is I have to put myself in an environment that's going to allow me to achieve that goal so for example if you set forth a goal of improving prayer let's just say someone gives you a talk and you get inspired and you say I want to improve my prayer then know that the environment in which prayer improves is to come into the muskid, join the gathering of the congregation and it's in that environment that the consistency will eventually develop and a person will be able to develop depth in their prayer that's the benefit of the environment of the muskid if I say to myself that you know Quran is a goal for example I make a goal for myself that I want to improve my recitation of Quran it becomes my responsibility to put myself into a plug myself into an environment that has established that now environment is very important because for example you might say that you know I want to improve my recitation of Quran so I'm going to go and work one on one with this teacher honestly that doesn't usually work for a couple of reasons number one you don't have an environment you just have an individual so you might be motivated today but tomorrow that motivation is going to dissipate and number two the teacher also needs an environment there's no teacher except that you have a school around them and that school also motivates them and it's the environment of the student and the environment of the teacher that when they link together that actually allows a person to be able to achieve their goals look at the US education system for a second and just compare it to history I would say that maybe 100 years ago, 150 years ago probably most of the most of the population was relatively illiterate sure a subset of people could read and write but most people were probably relatively illiterate but today is hard press to find someone who is illiterate particularly in the environment in which we grow up why? because you have these schools which are institutions, their environments everybody is inspired to learn because it's almost assumed it's a given nobody would think that my child should be illiterate or could be illiterate we're all inspired to learn but it's not enough to just say that I want my child to learn you can't just have a five-year-old sitting in front of you and say I want my child to learn in fact you can't even try to teach your child most of the time instead you have to recognize that I have to put them in the environment when I put them in school automatically within a few years not only is the child learning how to read and write but the child is writing their own essays the child is actually able to compute the child is able to do so many things that most people in history were never able to think about even doing why? because the environment the environment is what makes the difference and it's not only an environment by the way it's not just an environment for the student it's also an environment for the teacher when the teacher sits around and sees all these other teachers are also teaching and all these students are coming it inspires the teacher to continue with their craft and that allows the student to eventually develop we're no different in our dean we're dependent upon environment and so as we're inspired towards things if we're inspired towards knowledge knowledge is not going to come from the internet it's going to come from the environment of sitting in the company of other people who are also seeking knowledge and this is a good thing and we should take advantage of it every one of these institutions that you see in the area that are all serving the knowledge of the dean they create environments and we're grateful for them and we're thankful for them and we should plug ourselves into them and maybe I can't plug myself in full time but maybe I can plug myself in on the weekends maybe I can plug myself in at some sort of cadence that's appropriate for my schedule if a person wants to engage the Quran or learn the Quran again the first step is to be inspired towards that but the second step is to consistently plug themselves into some sort of gathering that's going to allow them to be able to achieve that goal so that means that we have to find institutions, organizations, gatherings in which people are advancing themselves in their recitation of Quran or memorization of Quran and then we should approach those gatherings and environments likewise spiritually you know it's one thing to say that I want to like I'm inspired to rectify myself I'm inspired to improve my character I'm inspired to improve my state of remembrance but it's not going to happen unless we plug ourselves into an environment we're all dependent upon the environment so we place ourselves in and Subhanallah when we plug ourselves into environments one of the important, one of the really unique benefits is that we actually usually we actually can often achieve far than what we would have ever imagined like I said like if you went back in history 200 years and you would have asked the people who were in charge of society at that time you know is it possible for all of society to be literate so much so that you're actually producing you know PhDs and people who are advancing knowledge of the material world they probably wouldn't have been able to fathom that what occurs today would be what we have present today would have been achievable but what happens is when people get into that environment the best version of themselves becomes expressed and the whole thing potentiates and becomes like additive so that in the end what ends up happening is that you produce something that even you would not have been able to imagine and I see this all the time you know people will tell me that you know I'm having difficulty maintaining my prayer we just had to retreat this weekend just as an example we had to retreat this weekend you know it would start it on Friday and it ended up this morning and a subset of those people as they came in and you know we like we like to speak to the attendees and some of them were very blunt and just said you know I'm having difficulty maintaining my prayer so the question is you know is it you or is it your environment so they come into the retreat and all of a sudden they're like energetic towards their dean they're actively maintaining their prayer they're doing all the things that they should do and at the end of the retreat I just told them like look it's not you you're obviously if you put yourself in this environment you're doing all these things that you would have never imagined you can actually make a list I prayed all the prayers in jama'a I heard the a'lan I responded to the a'lan I prayed to Hajiah I picked up the Quran this weekend I engaged myself in some of the kar and why were you why was that person able to do all that because if you just put people in the right environment often they can do things that they themselves never would have imagined because inspiration plus environment leads to results so understand the role of each aspect of our you know equation because I find that today people are very consumed by listening to lots of talks and they've equated that with dean like I just need to keep listening listen to four or five six hours worth of talks you know as if the talk is going to change me the talk never changes anybody it inspires people the purpose of any talk is to inspire what changes an individual allows them to tangibly have a benefit not just I heard a bunch of talks I heard a bunch of talks they went in one interview out the other what tangibly allows a change to arise in a person in the end is the environment so talks inspire but environments produce results and as we're inspired by our scholars which I'm not saying this isn't important it is important but what I'm saying is that we take the inspiration of our scholars we then identify environments that we need to place ourselves in in order to achieve the goals that we were inspired towards and this equation needs to be very well understood because honestly the environment once you're inspired the environment becomes more important than the inspiration whereas today it's so much consumption of this talk and that talk and this what do you call it those little short videos that people make you know this tick-tock and that tick-tock and people will clip this talk and clip that talk and it's like we're inspired and then we're inspired towards something else we're inspired towards something else and we become caught up in the inspiration of the message and not the environment so yes we should find environments that inspire us but then we actually need to make a step we need to actually take a step meaning you need to make an effort put ourselves in an appropriate environment if we decide obviously we should know this but when we decide that the Quran when we recognize the importance of the Quran we need to take one more step and it could be as simple as okay you know my commitment's going to be there's this monthly Quran program there's this weekly Quran program there's this twice a month Quran program I'm just going to plug myself into that but I'm going to you know get I'm going to get in my car I'm going to make will do I'm going to make the effort to come to the muskid I'm going to plug myself into the environment it could be that I want to deepen my salah so the deep depth of salah comes through the knowledge of the salah but then eventually through the practice of salah which the environment of the muskid provides and the muskid by the way the environment of the muskid is so important because again it's a place where we can express our inspiration it's not just about being inspired towards prayer it's about coming into the muskid which then allows a whole bunch of people to express that inspiration so anyway the summary for today is that handala we come here regularly and we seek to be inspired towards certain things but that's not the end goal it's an important step but it's not the end goal the end goal is to then when we're inspired ask the question what change am I going to make these are the environment to be able to achieve that goal for example again I just harping on this but the person who goes for hudge it's an inspirational event but the person who's going to have lasting change after hudge is the one who's going to adjust their environment and modulate it to be able to effectuate what they were inspired towards I mean you can't change in two weeks I mean yes people can change in two weeks but you can change your mindset in two weeks but you can't physically change in two weeks if you go for hudge but the inspiration right the mindset can change a person very quickly but then it's the environment that we plug ourselves into so as we're inspired towards things we should seek appropriate environments and just as the final point this doesn't apply only to us it applies to everyone that we have and quote unquote authority over so for example a mother and father in a home together have authority over their children so we have two responsibilities when we want to develop our children the first is to inspire them to inspire them towards the dean so that they see the dean is important they see the goals of the dean is their goals but that's not sufficient it's one step the next step is to find appropriate environments in which they can grow and develop so for example you find an appropriate school where they can learn the plan you find an appropriate school where they can express their Islamic identity or if an appropriate environment where they can express their Islamic identity you find an appropriate environment for example where they can learn Arabic if they're older whatever it might be but in the end goals are achieved through inspiration plus environment male spoonatala grant us circumstances that inspire us and male spoonatala allow us to be able to join the environments that will lead to effectuating the inspiration while at that one an alhamdulillahir al-Banana mean
