we are not fasting when we don't enjoy the benefits of Ramallah when we don't submerge ourselves in Qur'an when we don't keep ourselves in the company of one another we get deceived by the world

في المرحب ويقولني هذا الهيئي عندما لا ينظر ماذا نتحدث عن what we thought they said but we just make up a story in our minds it's never worth it it's never worth it to argue we're in the last 10 nights we all wish we knew exactly what was the night of power it's the mercy of Allah that we don't know so we make an effort on every one of these nights but on one occasion the prophet sallallahu alayhi sallam exited in order to inform the companions of the night of power on that in that particular year the prophet sallallahu alayhi sallam was approaching the companions with the knowledge and information of what was the night of power but what happened on his way he passed by two people who were arguing he passed by two people who were arguing when he passed by those two people the knowledge was uplifted and the prophet sallallahu alayhi sallam said perhaps that is better for you Subhanallah such a great blessing the ability to pinpoint laylatul qadr was provided yet two people were arguing over some petty thing which has absolutely no reality to it in the context of the knowledge of laylatul qadr but it was uplifted because of the argument so now you tell me when i pick up the phone and yell at someone because i'm upset and i start arguing with them who's the winner not me not the house not my family it's only shet on because all the barakah sucked out of the room all the barakah sucked out of the family all the barakah sucked out of the community we are shooting ourselves in the foot we are shooting ourselves in the foot and the only one in the stands that's cheering us on is shet on we are not enemies of one another we are brothers and sisters we are not enemies within families we are relations that are bound by the mercy of Allah in this day and in this these special days it's important to sit down and pause with it when we have this clarity of mind and we can finally see the benefits of shet on being tied up for the past 20 days because if we've made progress it's because shet on has been limited in his efforts correct so it behooves us to ask the question where are the disconnections in my life everyone has them because shet on is attacking everyone maybe it's me in my spouse maybe it's me in my uncle maybe it's me in my neighbor what's the big deal drop it go and say sorry what's the big deal honestly even if they were right and even if they were wrong and you were it's still cheaper it's still cheaper to just say you know what forget about it please forgive me it's not worth it because the door of jannah opens on mondays and thursdays and i have no need except to go back home i'm sick of this home there's nothing here i need to get back to my home and my home requires that i have an absolutely clean heart on one occasion and man we came into the musket in a state of woldo with water dripping from him with two sandals in his left hand the prophet i said i'm sad this is a man of jannah sohaba their curiosity was perked spanola we're trying to go to jannah we're giving our blood our tears our sweat our wealth and this guy gets labeled as a man of jannah so they became curious but they didn't say anything second day same thing happened the prophet i said this is a man of jannah third day same thing happened this is a man of jannah one of the companions said okay now i need to find out what is special about this man how is it that the prophet i said it is labeling him a person of jannah so what happens he goes to the man and he says i need to spend some time with you i'm not able to stay in my home there's a conflict can i spend some days with you man is a gracious gracious individual he says stay with me so he's watching the person he's watching the man that was labeled with jannah he sees that the person goes to sleep and doesn't wake up until fudge up he's thinking and i said this guy doesn't wake up for the hug it this guy's not praying in the middle of the night he just goes to bed and he wakes up when he prays fudge up there's nothing special about the person just an average individual except that he says good words days pass like this or time passes like this and the man eventually approaches him and says look you know i didn't have any conflict in my home there's a conflict in my home i used that as an excuse to spend some time with you because the prophet i said them said that you are a man of jannah so i want to see what deed are you doing so that i can inculcate that into my routine as well so the man thinks and he says i has nothing special that i'm doing but wait a minute actually there is one thing i don't hold any disagreements with other in my others in my heart i don't hold any grudges i don't know any grudges i let all the grudges go and i want good for everyone so then the companion said this is exactly why you're a man of jannah no grudges subhanallah we can't remember what happened 10 years ago but we hold grudges for 30 years 30 years i haven't talked to my this or that we hold grudge after grudge after grudge where is the energy coming we don't have the ability to remember what happened 10 years ago how do we have the energy to remember this grudge for 30 years because shepan is the one who fuels the fire because he does not want you and i to go home he wants us to be buried in the false nature of this world to pursue this false vanity at the price of the lasting hereafter this is an opportunity in these days for us to do the hard lifting it's hard it's very hard to go back and say i got to make up with this person i got to figure out how i'm going to correct this relationship it's hard it's not easy but this is the opportunity that sits before us this is what we should be using the momentum of rumble bond to do to pursue we should be asking the hard questions we should be looking at ourselves in the mirror we should be saying where are the things that i can improve where are the sins that are plaguing me let me seek forgiveness where are the relationships that are broken let me tie them where is the say god that i haven't paid let me pay what does do on me let me ensure that i fulfill my the things that the rights that are upon my shoulders this is the challenge that you and i face this is the true opportunity of rumble bond we call this world a home it is not a home we call this food food it is not food we call our bed a bed it is not a bed these are temporary when we get to jannah we'll see that there was no home except our home that there was no food except our food that there was no bed except our bed here we're deceived we're blinded because we're trapped in the body which wants to pursue its desires but the reality is this and this is what our dean has taught and this is what every messenger came with the reminder of to their people this world is passing all of you and i will move through it very quickly and the next generations will sit after us and they won't even remember our names the wealth that we have will be completely turned over to the people that come after us we can't take anything with us except our deeds may Allah SWT make us amongst those who are able to see the reality of this world and may he make us amongst those who were able to pursue our homes in the hereafter well put it out on a anil hamd al-Naheib al-Balani me
