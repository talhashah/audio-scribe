So the scholar said sit down. And the scholar started giving the talk again. و He gave the talk with the same energy, with the same passion, with the same focus, although there was one person sitting in front of him. So there was a third party who was observing all of this. At the end, He came to the scholar and he said, He said, You gave the talk, there were thousands of people sitting. I understand that. You were energetic, focused, excited. You delivered the message with such power. But then this one person came and you gave the same talk with such focus and such energy. I don't understand. I could have just given him a summary or just given him an apology. You actually gave him the same talk. So the share, he said, an interesting statement. He said, when there were tens of thousands of people in the room, I gave the talk for one. And when there was one person in front of me, I gave the talk for the same one. One here being capitalized. So you understand what the message is. The message is, although there were 10,000 people in the room, I was giving the talk, thinking that Allah's panellat Allah was watching me. So I gave the talk, focused on the one, capital one. And when there was one person, I gave the talk, focused on the one, capital one. Meaning, that the people are a distraction, their noise. Not saying that they're a distraction in the sense that they're not the purpose or intent of the talk, but they're in the end noise. Everything that we do is only for the sake of Allah. And if that intention is present, only then can there be true effect in what we do. Now you see today, the reason I shared this example with you, I've mentioned it before, but I'm sure at that time I had recently read it, and it was more eloquent, but again, the point I'm trying to make, is that you see in today's world, there is so much noise. People get so excited by the noise of that noise, meaning that people get excited. You know, I made a video, and 50,000 people watched my lecture, where I sent a tweet, and I don't know, six million people saw my tweet, or I gave a talk, and a thousand people were sitting in a talk. Whether that's the speaker, or whether that's the attendee, we have a human nature to get excited by noise. But in the end, it's very important to remember that this is all noise. You can't make judgments based on numbers, just because a whole bunch of people watch a video that someone puts up, or a whole bunch of people share something that you tweet at, or a whole bunch of people come to a particular place, doesn't mean that that's where the pleasure of Allah lies. And the intent always is the pleasure of Allah's panawat Allah. Everything else is noise. Now that's the nature of this world, correct? Because the world is essentially just a very noisy place, and it's the noise in this world that acts as a distraction, and we unfortunately get caught up in it all the time. We get caught up in dollar amounts. We get caught up in attention of others. We get caught up in the crowd. And we fail to appreciate that that is all noise. The only reality lies with Allah's panawat Allah. Look, even this is the case in the way in which we engage the world, and where we find ourselves. Do we not get excited about the meals that are potentially available? But is it not just noise? Do we not get excited about the potential homes in which we can live in? But is not that noise? Do we not get excited about the fashion that appeals to us, or the vehicles that we can drive, or the lifestyles that people live? But all of this is noise. Because there is no home here. There is only a home in the hereafter. There is no meal here. There is only the meal of the hereafter. There is no wealth here. There is only the wealth of the hereafter. And unfortunately, we can't snapshot the world and fast forward it to be able to appreciate it, but to panel out the world reveals itself to us. For example, you can look at a plate of food, and eventually you can fast forward and see that that plate will become rotten one day. And it doesn't take a long time. You can get this very, very nice expensive meal, put it in the fridge within four days, it's starting to smell, and it begins to reveal its true nature, which is that it rocks. There is no permanence to it. You look at the structures that people create, and as they create these structures, they eventually begin to crumble, and eventually they get torn down. It doesn't matter how much energy a person puts into producing it to begin with, it doesn't matter that they call it their dream home, it doesn't matter that they constructed it exactly the way they wish they could have lived their lives, in the end it begins to crumble, and the next person will tear it down. This is the reality of so much of what we pursue. Yesterday's fashion almost looks like a clown outfit today. The same thing that people were spending so much on, so much energy, focus, time, chasing, pursuing, today, it's not even worthy of being pursued. Nobody's going to walk around in the fashion of the 1880s. People will laugh if you walk in like that, and they'll say today isn't Halloween. Some people spend all their time money effort trying to accumulate these things, and if you walk in today, just like that, people will ask you, this is the nature of the world. The world is just a very, very noisy place. And it's important for us to appreciate this noise. We don't have, this is the beauty of the reality of our deen. It teaches us, la ilaha in la law, that there is nothing worthy of pursuing except Allah. And everything that we have at our disposal, has to be used for that pursuit, otherwise it's noise. Everything that we have at our disposal has to be used for that pursuit, otherwise it's noise. And if this is given value, then this is actually what has weight. Maybe we can say it another way, just to re-explain this from a different direction. You know that people look at deeds in this world. For example, there's many deeds that we perform in this world. People look at the actions of this world, but they fail to recognize that there is a multiplier against which every action will be weighed. People look at the actions of this world, but they fail to appreciate that there is a multiplier against which every action will be weighed. What do we mean by that? We mean that you can produce great actions. But if they're not for the sake of Allah's panawat ala, they become multiplied by zero and they end up being zero. For example, maybe I can give some sort of eloquent talk and the whole world can cheer me on, and I can have, I don't know, billion views, but if I did it for the sake of people's attention, or I did it for the sake of my own arrogance, then it will be multiplied by what? Zero and on the day of judgment, what apparently everybody thought to be so valuable and so special will actually be absolutely worthless. Whereas on the other hand, I could do a tiny deed, which no one sees, but it's truly for the sake of Allah. For example, there's a dog sitting by a well who's not able to get a drink from the well, and I simply take my shoe and I allow the dog to have a sip of water, but I did it out of the mercy of my heart and nobody else is watching. Maybe some hope, I have some hope from Allah's panawat ala, that single deed can get me into Jannah. That singular deed can get me into Jannah. Why? Because there's a multiplier. Giving a sip of water to a dog apparently seems to be worthless, but when it's multiplied by that ala in the law, it becomes weighty enough that it can put me into Jannah. And giving a talk with a billion followers might apparently seem to be weighty, but it's when it's multiplied against the fact that I did it for my own self, for my own arrogance, for the popularity of the attention and popularity from the people. It becomes multiplied by zero and it becomes absolutely worthless. This is the reality by which we see the world. The world is caught up in the noise. They're caught up in how many followers as a person have. How much influence, what type of influencer are they? How much wealth does a person have? What's their fashion? What's their lifestyle? What restaurants do they eat at? But these are all noise. These are all worthless. Yes, maybe I agree with you that in the moment they appear to be valuable. But we don't live in the moment. We live in a reality. We know that there is actually a far greater moment than this moment, which is the day of judgment. That moment that all these things will be weighed. This is a very, very, very court concept for all of us, because it is the non-negotiable premise of Ardine. Lots of things you can negotiate and discuss. There's a non-negotiable premise of Ardine, which is La'ilahah and Malak. And it's that which actually gives us weight. So we don't judge based on the popularity of something. We don't judge based on the fact that the whole world may be heading in one direction, and we may be going in a different direction. We don't judge based on what people may think. Yes, of course, there are some angles to those things, and we have wisdom in the way by which we deal with the world. But we have a different world of view. See, the world around us doesn't have this view, but there is a law who created them to whom they have to answer. Everything has to be done for his sake. There's a day of judgment. They will face the consequence of their deeds. Their deeds may actually turn out to be heavier or light, depending on what it was done for, what the intent was behind it. There's a day of judgment. There's going to be Jinnan Jahnnam. The vast majority of the world doesn't function in this with this world of view. The vast majority of the world, not the vast majority. Much of the world is not functioning with this world of view. Much of the world is essentially functioning on a whole different paradigm. They view the world differently. They view wealth as an end goal. They view popularity as a sign of success. They view the number of people that like you as a way by which you can judge, whether you've actually done something valuable. By the here, by the here, what I mean here, by the number of people that like you, is these quote, likes that you see on social media. That's a different world of view. We don't live in that paradigm. Just because a whole bunch of people live in that paradigm doesn't mean that we live in that paradigm. Doesn't make it right. Doesn't make it the way by which the world should be viewed. We have an absolutely different paradigm. And that paradigm starts with La Ilaha Inmallah. We see the whole world for the reality, for the reality that for what it really is, say it that way. We see the whole world for what it really is. We understand that the whole place is a mirage. Everything is just a illusion. The only reality is the reality of the hereafter. And that this simply is a testing ground. And the testing ground contains two components to every deed. Component number one, the intention, component number two, the action. Every deed has two components. Component number one, the intention, component number two, the action. Sometimes an action can be small, but the intention is so big that when you multiply the two, you get a very big number. And sometimes the action can be big, but the intention is so low and so small that you multiply the two and you get a very small number. Like I said, a million times zero is a million. Sorry, a million times zero is zero. So this is the way by which we have to live in the world and appreciate its reality. And we should be where? We get swept away by the noise. We get swept away because we're in that world. We're seeing social media, we're seeing what's celebrated in the world around us. We're seeing the fashions and the trends and so much so that even when the world moves in a direction that's away from Islam, away from Dean, away from this goodness that we've been blessed with, we're ready to run as well. And we're asking the question, how much of my Dean can I chuck behind me in order to make me a little lighter so I can run in that direction? No. I'm not the Dean of the very clear mind. My focus is on Allah. My attention is on Allah. I'm seeing the world through a very different lens. I look at the world as a place where I have opportunity to be able to earn reward not for this world, but to hear after. I have to avoid mistakes because they could weigh me down in my pursuit. And then I take every single action that comes before me. The way I do it and I do it is in consequential. I pause before I perform that action. I say Bismillah to remind myself of the purpose of that action to ensure that I do it only for the sake of Allah, essentially a multiplier, and then with Bismillah, I step forward and I produce that action or deed, whatever it might be. And along the way, I recognize that there's going to be mistakes. I'm not going to see the world for what it really is. I might pursue the things that I shouldn't be pursuing. I may lose myself in the moment and forget that I'm the servant of Allah and that he's always watching. And it happens. And then when that occurs, I turn back to my foundation, meaning what? I turn back to Allah's panawattah Allah. I seek forgiveness for wherever my shortcomings might have been. And I turn attention back towards Him and I look for the next opportunity. This is the world view and world understanding of the Muslim. Everything around us is noise. Just because people make it loud doesn't make it any more real. Just because people make it glop doesn't change its reality. Just because people make, talk up something doesn't make that lasting. It's a mirage. You can make it brighter, you can make it louder, you can make it more dimensional, increased the pixels, doesn't change reality. All of it will come down. It's a curtain. All of it will come down one day. And when that curtain comes down, we're going to be facing our Lord. We're going to see the Jannah and Jahnnah that have been promised. And we're going to be left looking at ourselves and our deeds. It's simple. It's simple that the Dean isn't complex in the sense that the greater concepts of the Dean are not complex. The problem is that we get caught up in the noise. I'm going to ask any common Muslim on the street. They know the basics of the Dean. What is there? It's such a beautiful, beautiful, beautiful aspect of the Dean. Is that anybody can comprehend it. La ilaha illa Allah. I've got these handful of beliefs. I've got these handful of pillars. These are the things I need to do. The big things I need to avoid. Very, very sensible. You don't need to go get some PhD. Where does the challenge lie? The challenge doesn't lie that I don't know what I need to do. We all know what we need to do. The challenge lies in that the world is a big distraction. People make lots of noise. The world glows and glitters trying to attract us. We get distracted. That's where the challenge lies. But Subhanallah, we have to continuously remind ourselves. Continuously remind ourselves that the world is full of lots of noise. That this place is a test. It has been created in order to judge our deeds. And our deeds are a reflection of our calema. And that everything that we do should only be for the sake of Allah. And we shouldn't get distracted and pursuing the things that apparently seem real but are not real. Instead, we should focus on what is real, although we can't see it. And what is real in front of us? It is the fact that there is a jannah and a jahnnam, and that we have the opportunity to be able to earn a lost pleasure. And what greater good an opportunity can there be. And what greater good an opportunity can there be. Mellahas Pallahi wa Ta'ala, keep us focused on the reality of our existence. Despite the complex world in which we live, Mellahas Pallahi wa Ta'ala, allow us to be able to keep our focus on him. May he make all of our deeds for him and him alone. And may he make us amongst those who are able to avoid that which displeases him. Wa Al-Kharat al-A'ana, Anil Hamd al-Ila, Irub al-Alamin.
