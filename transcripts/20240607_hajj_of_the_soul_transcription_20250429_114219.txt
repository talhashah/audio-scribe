You can see the excitement over the past few days of many people appearing themselves for the journey of Hajj. And the journey of Hajj actually has two important dimensions to be aware of. The first dimension is the physical journey of Hajj. And the physical journey of Hajj essentially involves leaving from one's homeland and then making the journey to Mecca. And then from Mecca eventually awaiting the days of Hajj until you then have to travel to these various desert plains from Mecca to Arfa to Muzelefa back to Mecca. You make these little journeys within this major journey and physically you're moving from place to place. So that's one dimension of the journey. So literally what happens in Hajj over a short period of time, people are literally, literally, people depending on where you're coming from, which part of the world you're coming from. But some people are traveling up to tens of thousands of miles. Because you're traveling all the way from here, for example, to Mecca, from there you're traveling within the region of the Haram a little bit outside of the Haram event. So you might go to Medina whether that's first or second and then eventually you travel back. So you can see that there's this physical journey that people are taking. And the physical journey has a whole slew of features associated with it. Along with the physical journey, however, there's a second journey. And the second journey is actually the true journey. And that is that the journey, that is that the soul is also taking the journey. So the body is moving from place to place, correct? The body might be moving from Chicago to Mecca, Mecca, to Meena, Meena, to Arfa, Arfa, to Muzelefa, etc. That's the body's journey. But there's also a journey of the soul. And what is the journey of the soul? The journey of the soul is that they're traveling from a lifetime of sin all the way to acceptance into gender. Now if you said to me, a hug is a really long journey. I would say sure, because maybe thousands or tens of thousands of miles that a person might be traveling in order to make the journey for a hug. There's a great length there. But honestly, that length is nothing compared to the greater length of going from sin, a lifetime of sin, all the way to acceptance to gender. I mean, think about it for a second. It's actually phenomenal that in five days, a person makes the journey of an entire lifetime. So it doesn't matter what the status of the person is. As long as they're turning to Allah's panellatullah with hope and with desire, they could be all the way here. Literally, they could be all the way at the extreme of like a deep sinner who spent their whole life disobeying Allah's panellatullah. And if they perform a hug without obscenity, etc., they end up at the point where they come back as a newborn baby. And if the hug is accepted, they end up in gender. Now, one thing is like, you know what? On maps, they put those scales. You know, every, I don't know, in this case, let's say every thousand miles is a scale. So when you're thinking about the physical scale, you're thinking about maybe how many scales this person travel in order to get from Chicago to, in this case, as an example, Chicago to Mecca. But actually, that's not the impressive part of the journey. That is a big part of the journey. Everybody's preparing by in their tickets, thinking how they can get there, thinking about all the stops they have to make, thinking about what they have to do at every particular stop. That's all relevant. But the real fantastic part of the journey is the scale that in five days, you're traveling from no matter where you are on this category of sin, all the way to this category of acceptance. And so panellat, this is exactly the description of Hajj. The publicized center mentioned that an individual who performs a hug without obscenity, that they will return from Hajj like a newborn baby. What does that mean? A newborn baby? Let me ask you something. If somebody has a child, and the parents say, here's my newborn baby, and somebody says, this baby is a sinner. There's no way this baby is a sinner. You have a massive problem in your mind. You're telling me that this baby is a sinner. This baby hasn't even had the ability to open their eyes. How could this baby be a sinner? This baby has no ability to make intent. How can this baby be a sinner? It's not possible in our minds that somebody could say to you, there's a newborn baby that's a sinner because they're so pure, inherently so pure, that the question doesn't even come in the mind. Here, the prophesies center is using an analogy of a newborn baby to show how pure somebody comes back, how pure a person becomes when they go for Hajj. Just as it would not be fathomable in our minds that a newborn baby could even have any sin or be a sinner. In the same way, if somebody goes to Hajj and they perform a hug without obscenity, etc, they come back as a newborn, basically a newborn baby. Spiritually, spiritually. Now, what is that? That's not a physical journey. They're not going to come back in a crib and a cradle. Nobody's talking about a physical journey. They come back in a crib and a cradle. It's a spiritual journey. They went from such an extreme. You know how complicated an adult is? How malicious their intents can become? I mean, we think about it in our own minds. We're trying to be the best people we can, but how many crazy ideas come up in the mind? And you think about even when we make an intent to be as good as we can, how many mistakes we make along the way? Even if we didn't want to make those mistakes, just how many mistakes inherently arise in the complex nature of life. We say we think things we shouldn't say. We do things we shouldn't do. We behave in ways we shouldn't behave. But Hajj has the ability to pick us up no matter where we are on that spectrum and literally drag us backward in time, spiritually, to make us as pure as the day we were born. That's phenomenal. If that doesn't mesmerize, by the way, that hadith is narrated in both Buhadi and Muslim. That person comes back as pure as they were, was a newborn. If that doesn't mesmerize us, now you think about, okay, let's just assume I'm at neutral for a second. Right? Because what was the first phase of the journey? The first phase of the journey was I'm spiritually in this state, meaning I've performed all these sins. I'm coming with a bucket load of mistakes on my shoulders. And this journey now has the ability to reset me to zero. I'm a newborn. But a newborn still wouldn't have had the ability to do all the deeds that could put them in a very special state in Jannah. Sure, they're pure inherently, so that purity will allow them to get into Jannah. But the prophylation of them has been taking us one step further. He's telling us that, AND, this is against separate narration, and the accepted—the—the—the—the—the—the—the— the—the—the—the—the—the—the—the—the—the—the—the—the—haj—that's accepted. It's reward is nothing other than Jannah. لا. هذا هو فرامل. لأن now you're going from, you know, just let's say empty slate to such a situation that your reward is nothing other than genuine. So now think about that scale. One who was this piece was amazing, this piece was amazing put the whole thing together in five days, this entire span becomes absolutely amazing. So yes, there's a physical journey and I realize that many of you have family members and we all are looking at them with, you know, desire ourselves. We wish we could be the ones that were making that physical journey. But Subhanallah, beyond the physical journey, it's so important to appreciate that this just isn't just any physical journey. It's actually a journey of the soul, the physical movements that we make are a mechanism by which we empower the soul to be able to make the journey from this extreme all the way to this extreme. Subhanallah. Now what's important for us to appreciate, the reason I'm having this discussion with you, I'm not going for Hudge, why is he talking about Hudge, he's just pouring salt on the wound. But actually the reality is, what we should appreciate is that even if you don't make the physical journey, you still have the ability in these days to make a spiritual journey and it doesn't matter where you're located. And that's the essence of the Hudge. Okay, you're going to be in Chicago wherever you live, you're staying in Chicago for the next 10 days. But there is a dimension of Hudge that allows us to still jump on that bandwagon in order to be able to make the spiritual journey of Hudge. For example, the Prophet's eye said and mentioned that there are no days more beloved to Allah for good deeds. There are no days in which deeds are more beloved to Allah than these 10 days of Hudge. There are no days more beloved to Allah in which we place our deeds than these 10 days of Hudge. Highlighting what? Highlighting that even if we don't have the ability to physically make that journey, if we appreciate the spiritual journey that's occurring, and we plug into that greater metaphysical reality, we have the ability to be able to make a journey as well. In fact, just to understand this narration a little better, the scholars, they say, that in the gear, if you want to classify now, you know the year is made of days, everybody knows that it's obvious, right? You make a three calendar of years, but the years are actually made up, a year is made up of a bunch of dates. So the scholars, they say that within a year, the best nights of the entire year are the last 10 nights of Ramadan. The best nights of the entire year are the last 10 nights of Ramadan, and all of us, how much we look forward to the last 10 nights of Ramadan. But the best days in the calendar are the 10 days of the Hidja. We're literally at the precipice of those days, if not in those days, depending on whether you're looking at moon sighting or whether you're looking at calculation. Let's put that aside for a second, that's not relevant to today's conversation. The point is we're at the precipice of those days. The opportunity is right here. So we should appreciate, see it's a deception to think that I'm not going for Hajj, so I'm just going to maintain whatever I'm normally doing. No, no, I understand, I'm not going for Hajj, I'm not going for the physical Hajj, but the spiritual Hajj is a piece of that is always available to me. So much so that these are the 10 days, and I should not simply bump into these 10 days without appreciating who I met. Imagine you go to the airport, you bump into some famous person, you don't know who they are, somebody later tells you, oh this was the all star of the NBA. It's oh my god, I didn't know, I wish I would have known, I would have shaken his hand, I would have taken a picture, correct? We're bumping into these days of the Hidja, we should know who we're meeting. We're meeting the days that are most beloved to Allah, which means that it's an opportunity for every one of us because the classification of the most beloved days is predicated on the fact that those are the most beloved days for deeds. So we should have a plan, just like the people of Hajj have a plan, I'm going to Mecca, once the days of Hajj, I'm going to go to Mecca, from Mecca, I'm going to go to Allah, etc, etc, they have a plan in their mind, they've mapped out this global scheme of how they're going to get this journey to go from being a sinner. All the way to going to one who's a reward is nothing other than Jannah, they have a map in their mind physically, we should have a map in our mind spiritually. These days have come upon us, we should start thinking, I have to increase my liquor. It doesn't even have to be anything extensive. Maybe I'm just going to come back to my routine. A few minutes of Ishtikfar, a few minutes of Salawat, a few minutes of engaging the Quran, maybe the morning, the evening, some basic simple routine. This is a time to plug that in because if we plug it in and we're consistent for the 10 days, the journey is such that maybe we'll be able to leverage that momentum and be able to carry that momentum into the days that come beyond these 10 days. Something simple, something very simple, doesn't need to be extensive, it needs to be really simple so that it can be consistent. So this is one opportunity that we should be reflecting on. We should think about the charity that we give in these days. One of the great acts of our deen is to give charity. We should think about how much charity are we giving, we should review our finances, we should look for opportunities locally within our families, nationally, internationally, in order to distribute the wealth that Allah has bestowed us with. You only give in a few chips in the game. You know, when you play any game, you get some pieces or some chips or some cards or whatever it might be. You only give in a few chips in the game. What are the chips in this game? We're given time and we're given wealth. We take that time and we convert it into good deeds. We're given wealth and we convert that into an investment in the hereafter. That's essentially the game that we're playing. So it shouldn't be that we're just thinking about how we're going to use our time without thinking about how we're going to use our wealth. And if Allah has blessed us with wealth, we should maybe throughout these days think about how we should be spending it. And perhaps we should also ask the question, is there anything that's due on me? Maybe I have some Zekha that's due on me. Maybe I have some prayers that are due on me, whatever it might be, we should think about what we have due upon us. So this is one dimension of the journey that despite the fact that we didn't make that physical journey that we spiritually can engage in. In fact, if you take this one step further, it's narrated that it was the habit of the provost eye, send them. It was the habit of the provost eye, send them to fast in these 10 days of the Hidja. Now, 10 days we mean 9 because the 10th is going to be 8 and 8 we're not going to fast. So the 9 days of the Hidja was the habit of the provost eye, send them to fast on those days. But that actually goes one step further. Because although that was his habit, he specifically advised us to fast on the 9th of the Hidja. And not only did he advise us to fast on the 9th of the Hidja, but he told us the journey that we ourselves are able to make on the 9th of the Hidja. And what is that? The provost eye said that the individual who fast on the 9th of the Hidja, one year's prior sins are forgiven and one year's future sins are forgiven. Now, same story. There's a journey that's occurring here, right? A person who didn't make any journey. Think about it for a second. A person who didn't make any physical journey has no ticket, has no visa, has no permission to show up at college. They're able to do what? They're able to produce one fast on the 9th of the Hidja. And that one fast allows them to take such a journey that one year's prior sins and one year's potential future sins begin to become forgiven. That's a journey as well. And that's an opportunity for everybody in this room and we should not let that opportunity go. What is it a few hours of refraining from food, drink, a few simple things? And we get this ability to leverage the whole season of hudge by having one year's prior sins and one year's future sins forgiven. It's a great opportunity. But it's again, it's a reminder, just as the people who are physically going or taking advantage of it, we too should have a plan to take advantage of it. By the way, just as a asterisk, when the prophesies and the mentions, the scholars they mentioned, that it's also an iteration, but when a person won't, when it stated that the prior sins are forgiven and the future sins are forgiven, they understanding here is that those are the minor sins. What are the minor sins? It's a simple mistakes that we make throughout our day, which just are a consequence of us making the best effort to live life. But we avoid those things because we end up encountering those things just as a process of going through our day. It's not some intended thing. It's something that just occurs because of mistakes along the way. All of those sins are wiped away. All of those sins are wiped away. And perhaps in the background of such cleanliness and purity, it forces a person to ask a deeper question, which is, okay, then what major sins do I have? No, you know, one of the scholars, they say something interesting here, by the way, when it said that the minor sins of the prior year and the minor sins of the major, the next year, sorry, the minor sins of the prior year and the minor sins of the future year are wiped away, the scholars, they say that the reason that that's not explicitly stated in the narration, because what is the narration? The narration is that the sins of the prior year and the sins of the future year are forgiven. The reason that this clause of minor sins is not stated is because when you're speaking to a group of Muslims, they don't pursue the major sins. The standard for any Muslim is that if they were ever to fall in a major sin, they would be so distraught, that they would break down in tears, promise themselves that they would never do it again and wipe it away because it's just not the nature of a Muslim to be involved in a major sin. So it goes without saying, saying, because every person who would, every Muslim who did desiring Allah in his messenger, if Allah sent them, if they were to ever fall into a major sin, would clearly be remorseful, would clearly make an intention to never do it again and would clearly make amends for it. That's just the nature of any Muslim. So when we say here that the minor sins of the prior year and the future are forgiven, the understanding is that Muslims would be avoiding major sins and would quickly rectify any major sin that ever arose. My simple point here, however, is to remind myself and everyone else that these are the days to take advantage of another journey. To not be just caught up in the fact that am I going on the physical journey? Sure, the physical journey is an expression of something physical which we fill with something metaphysical, something spiritual. But just because we're not physically going on the journey doesn't mean we don't have the ability to take advantage of the spiritual benefits of a hedge, in particular of the days of the hedge. And these are going to come upon us because look, the vast majority of years in our life unless you happen to be fortunate enough to be able to go consistently because maybe you're doing some service of the people who go for hedge. The vast majority of the days, years of our life, we won't be going for hedge. But does that mean that we can't take advantage? No, we can't take advantage. And just as the last point to close, when everyone in this room is thinking, and that's what I hope that we're going to establish here, that we need to think about this opportunity. When everybody's thinking, we should look in the mirror and ask ourselves, what is our journey? What is our journey? Meaning, you know, one of the beautiful features of Hudge is that everybody goes as an individual, they come with their own backgrounds, they come with their own circumstances, they come with their own potentials, but Hudge has the ability to allow each of those people to be able to take the next step in their personal journey. Everyone here is at a different phase in their own journey. So when we think about how I'm going to take advantage of these days, their response might be a little different for every person in this room. For example, maybe I'm struggling with my prayers. I know that there's five prayers in a day. I obviously have committed my, to perform these prayers, but maybe I'm having trouble with my prayers. Maybe I delay them, delay them, delay them because I'm getting busy on my computer, get busy on my device, get busy at work, get busy, whatever distracts me, and I'm praying the prayers towards the very end of the time. Alright, so maybe this is an opportunity to rectify that and to try to pray the prayers at the beginning of the time unless we happen to be going to the message. Maybe I am sleeping through prayers or missing prayers because I go to bed early or missing prayers because I sit and watch on my screen watching something I get so tired I can't even get out of bed and pray. A shout prayer for example. So maybe I make amends there. Maybe I pray my prayers consistently, but I don't regularly get to the mustard. So maybe I add an additional prayer in the mustard at this point trying to build on that to get into the mustard as much as possible. Everybody's in a different circumstance here. We're not here to judge one another. We're here to help one another on a bigger journey, which is the journey of being judged by a lost panellatel. That's the purpose of any community. Not to judge one another and bury each person when they, when they falter, which unfortunately the world is that way. Every time someone makes any kind of slip, we want to advertise it and bury them. That's not the way a community works. A lost panellatel is the judge. We're simply a group of people that are traveling together and the goal is to assist one another, which is a whole other discussion about the hug. The ability that we gain to that journey to be able to assist one another so that all of us can achieve our goal together. That's a separate talk. We're not going to go there today. Again, the simple summary is that the physical journey of Hudge is a reminder of a much greater spiritual journey. And although a person may travel thousands of miles physically, they're traveling eons spiritually. And that spiritual journey should mesmerize us because it takes a person from the extreme of sin to the extreme of acceptance and to gender. But at the same time, we should appreciate that that physical journey, although it may not occur, is not always required in order to take advantage of some of the blessings of Hudge. Sure, it's mandatory upon us. We all know that. But there is a spiritual journey that every one of us can take in these days, which is to perform as many good deeds as possible, to increase our fasting with a strong emphasis on the ninth of the Hidja to gain the reward of having one year's prior sins and one year of future sins. And to use these beautiful days, which are the most beloved days in the entire year, the most beloved days in the entire year to represent ourselves before Allah. Just like in Ramadan, we might think, I wish I could become this. I wish I would be that. I wish I would change my life in this way. I recognize and made all these mistakes. Let me take advantage of these days. We should have that same attitude in these days. These are such special days. We should approach these days in the same way, thinking, okay, this is an opportunity for me to reflect on where I am and an opportunity for me to think about what I'm going to be in the next year. By the way, it's interesting. The month of the Hidja, you understand that there are 12 months in the Islamic calendar, just as there are 12 months in the solar calendar. And what is the very last month? The very last month of the Hidja. And I think one of the things that you see as human beings in general, so when you get to the end of something and you're about to start something new, you always think about how you can improve. Do you think that every American in the month of December makes resolutions for January? I think everybody in our culture appreciates that in the month of December, it's a time of reflection. Here's what I did last year. Here's who I want to be next year. I haven't been exercising. Let me sign up for an exercise membership. I haven't been studying. Let me make a study schedule. I haven't been a child or son or daughter that I should have been. Let me think about how I'm going to behave with my parents. It's human nature. When you come to the end of something and you begin something the next phase of something, you think about it. It doesn't every student enter school saying I'm going to get straight A's in August. It doesn't matter what the grades were in the past. They always say, now this year I'm going to get straight A's. Correct? So that's the nature of human beings. And this is the 12th month of the Islamic calendar. Again, it's beautiful the way these things come together because the momentum that's generated by coming to the end of a year also leads into the opportunity to take advantage of the next year. The next year will begin as soon as this month of the jazover. So again, it's a great time of reflection. These are very special days. May Allah's peace and blessings be upon you. Allow us to be able to appreciate both the physical and the spiritual journey that occurs during Hajj and May. We grant the opportunity to be able to take advantage of these very special days. Wa'ah-Hurud-Dauhanan and Hamdul-Ina-Rul-Badad-Alamin.
