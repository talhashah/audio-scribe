So for example, one type of Dikur is the Dikur of the tongue where a person resides certain litneys. If I ask you, give me an example of Dikur some of you might say saying Subhanallah, saying Alhamdulillah, saying the Ilaha Imlullah. Obviously there's a series of ethical or that are going to be on the screen and you know shortly once we complete the talk. So these are all, this is all Dikur and this is Dikur of the tongue. This is one type of Dikur and it's probably the most common one, the most common subtype, the type that we all can quickly relate to when we hear the word Dikur. A second type of Dikur is the Dikur of the mind. So for example, gaining knowledge in our Dean is a very important type of Dikur. When we gain knowledge of our Dean it is a type of remembrance of Allah and anytime we learn anything related to our Dean. For example, I learn how to pray, I learn the issues related to prayer, the issues related to Wulu, the issues related to Ma'alqida, etc. All of that is a type of Dikur of Allah and that's the Dikur of the mind. A third type of Dikur is a Dikur of the heart. What is the Dikur of the heart? The Dikur of the heart is essentially a state and it's a state in which a person is remembering Allah's panawata Allah or remembering issues related to our Dean but it's deeply embedded within their heart. It's not something that's necessarily coming from the tongue. It's not something that's being imagined in the mind. Although there's a connection between the tongue and the mind and the heart, it's an independent type of Dikur. And this is a deeper type of Dikur in the sense that it's harder to achieve but it's the goal of every Muslim. Every Muslim should be in a state of consciousness of Allah's panawata Allah which we call Takwa and whereas Takwa was not located on the tongue, Takwa was not located in the mind, Takwa was located in the heart. In fact the Prophet ﷺ said, Takwa haa hoonah pointing to the heart, Takwa is here. So this is a third type of Dikur. Essentially there's three types of Dikur. This is the first point I'm trying to make today. Three types of Dikur. Dikur number one, the Dikur of the tongue. Dikur number two, the Dikur of the mind which is knowledge. Dikur number three, is the Dikur of the heart, which is essentially the states that we enter visa v. our relationship with Allah's panawata Allah. And it's the goal of every Muslim to constantly be in a state of Dikur. We should be consistently making Dikur with our tongue. We should be consistently remembering Allah and issues related to our Dina in our heart. And we should be consistently understanding what are the things that please Allah and how can we achieve those to the highest degree. And what are the things that displeas Allah and how can we avoid those to the best of our ability. This is essentially the summary. So first point again, there are three types of Dikur. Now the second point, which is just a little subtle, is that everyone is always in a state of Dikur. And normally if you talk to a person, you might say, you know, in a casual conversation, we encourage one another towards Dikur. But I will say to you that Dikur is inherent to every single human being. And in fact, every person on the planet is continuously making Dikur. You might say, that's crazy. What do you mean every person on the planet is continuously making Dikur? How can that be? You have to broaden your scope here a little bit. You have to broaden your perspective a little bit. When we think about Dikur, Dikur is simply a remembrance. It's a remembrance of the mind, a remembrance of the tongue, a remembrance of the heart. Everyone is doing that all the time. The question is, what are people doing Dikur of? Are they doing... There's two things to do Dikur of. Either a person is doing Dikur of Allah or a person is doing Dikur of themselves. These are the two states that a human being is always in. Either a person is doing Dikur of Allah or a human being is doing Dikur of themselves. For example, every day person wakes up in the morning, let's just say they're non-Muslim for a second, or even non-Muslims. Person wakes up in the morning, now they start thinking, what am I going to have for breakfast? What am I going to have for breakfast? The moment we start thinking about what am I going to have for breakfast, we're doing Dikur. What we're doing, Dikur of ourselves. How am I going to fulfill my needs or how am I going to fulfill my desires? Now I pick up the phone, I start talking to my friend, or who picks up the phone anymore, sorry. Now I start texting my friend, and I say, hey, you're free for breakfast this morning. So they say, oh, yeah, I'm free. Where do you want to go? Oh, I want this. I want this. I want this. I want this. Now all this stuff comes from the tongue. Now what is the tongue really doing? The tongue is doing Dikur. But it's engaging in Dikur of the self. Now the person says, okay, we go for breakfast. Look at the menu. Even before they look at the menu, they desire French toast. Nobody had to remind them there's nothing there. It's coming from the heart. The moment they see the French toast, they say, oh, that's exactly what I was thinking. It's exactly what I was. No, they say it this way. I'm feeling French toast today. That's an interesting statement. I'm feeling French toast today. Such a deep state of Dikur, I'm feeling French toast today. But essentially, what is that? If you just look at it from one angle, it's really people doing Dikur of themselves. The human beings are designed to do Dikur. They're designed to do Dikur. But they essentially do Dikur of themselves. Now, the breakfast is over. The person goes to work. Now when they go to work, they start sitting with their co-workers and everybody's talking about salary, everybody's talking about position, everybody's talking about who's the CEO. This is all type of Dikur. Everyone is essentially making Dikur. The person starts plotting and planning in their mind. The person more than anything wants something from their heart. All of this is type of Dikur. People are doing Dikur of where they're going to live. People are doing Dikur of what they're going to eat. People are doing Dikur of what they're going to wear. People are doing Dikur of other celebrities. People are doing Dikur of the life that they imagined themselves to live. And what happens? That Dikur drives them. It drives them to go half an hour to get breakfast. It drives them to stand half an hour outside of the breakfast place because there's a long line. It drives them to save up and stretch as far as they can to purchase the next thing that they desire. It drives them to cry when they were trying to get a house but their bid didn't get accepted. How many emails like that do I get? They're crying. They're literally crying that their bid didn't get accepted. As if there's no other house. Okay, I get it. I mean, it's a human reaction. But the point is what's generating such powerful movement of human being for half an hour, stand in line, go get this breakfast, go buy this, want to do this, thinking about this, checking this. What's driving all of that? It's Dikur of what though? It's Dikur of the self. It's me, me, me. What am I? What do I want? What do I need? What do I hope for? Why can't I have? Islam breaks the shackle of the Dikur of the self. That's another way to look at Islam. Islam breaks the shackle because when a person does Dikur of themselves they become shackled to their desires. Now I'm shackled to what I want to eat. I'm shackled to the lifestyle that I expect to live. I'm shackled to the place that I think I should be, the house I should be living in, the neighborhood I should be in. I'm shackled to all of these things. I bind myself and I get caught up in the dunya. What does Islam do? Islam has the key to those shackles. Islam reminds us that we should be doing the Dikur of Allah. And when we do the Dikur of Allah that drives us to achieve Allah's pleasure and a reward in the hereafter. And it's this yin and yang between me and Allah's panel, the Dikur of me and the Dikur of Allah that every human being is fluctuating through. Now, Spanala, I'll just tell you the vast majority of humanity is just continuously doing Dikur of themselves. They're just continuously doing Dikur of themselves. But the Muslim, even though they get caught up in the Dikur of themselves, is forced to do the Dikur of Allah. The Masha'ikh, you know, it's interesting. I mentioned this before and I mentioned this topic slightly before. The Masha'ikh, they often, when you read the ladder writings of any teacher, any sheikh, they put lots of emphasis on the Dikur of Allah. But what I mean, the ladder writings, I mean the writings towards the end of their lives. They put lots of emphasis on the Quran and they put lots of emphasis on the Dikur of Allah. Yeah, I mean the Dikur of Allah is obviously highly emphasized. But if you think about it from one perspective, why are they saying that? They're saying that because essentially all of life is just basically a type of Dikur. And we're being reminded here that the more we make the Dikur of Allah, the more we're going to take all of the faculties that we have, delete the transient nature of this world, and achieve the permanent reality of the hereafter. But it requires the Dikur of Allah. So for example, you might wake up and you might be doing A, B, and C, but we're immediately reminded to make the Dua of waking up to think Allah's Qawla for having, allowed us to be able to experience another day. When we make Bulu, we're doing the Dikur of the preparation for prayer. When we get to the prayer, we're turning our attention away from everything starting our day on the remembrance of Allah. Now I leave the prayer, and once I get out of prayer, yes, I can easily get distracted as a Muslim. I may get a little bit distracted, but even in my state of heedlessness, what is heedlessness except my own Dikur, even in my state of doing Dikur of myself, Islam pauses me several times throughout the day, and says, wait a minute, doesn't matter what you're doing, if you're doing Dikur of the time for the Duhar, you have to make Bulu, you have to slow down, you have to turn away from the Dikur of yourself and turn towards the Dikur of Allah. And that's what each of the prayers is. Same with wealth. When a person has wealth, they start counting, counting, counting. They're doing the Dikur of what they're going to buy, they're doing the Dikur of what they're going to invest in, and how they're going to grow their wealth, and Islam pauses the person. And says, wait a minute, you're doing the Dikur of yourself. This 2.5% is for the Dikur of Allah, at a minimum. And if you can give more, it's even better. Same thing with fasting. We're used to this routine where we think about food, in fact most people revolve their lives around food, it's all revolved around breakfast, then one lunch, then dinner, and how am I going to fill the time in between? And all of that is paused when a person fast, and they're reminded to do the Dikur of Allah, instead of doing the Dikur of their desires and their stomachs. From so many angles, you'll see that within the Dean, obviously the whole Dean is a Dikur of Allah, but it is so beautifully established at a cadence that allows every Muslim to reset themselves. This is the challenge for all of us to keep in mind. When we engage in anything, we should remember that everything is a type of Dikur. And the only question is, what are we doing Dikur of? Now, why is this so dangerous to do the Dikur of ourselves? Obviously, because when we do the Dikur of ourselves, we end up losing sight of the greater reality and becoming hyperfixated on me, myself, and I. That's what the Dikur of Allah, sorry, that's what the Dikur of the self does. And I'll tell you that there are many diseases of the heart. For example, envy is a disease of the heart. Pride and arrogance is a disease of the heart. Conceit is a disease of the heart. But all of these diseases are essentially expressed when a person does Dikur of themselves and leaves the Dikur of Allah. And if you just listed for me every disease of the heart, I'll tell you that the cure for the vast majority of the diseases of the heart is actually just the Dikur of Allah. Because they arose due to the Dikur of the self. I'll give you one simple example, and we will cap this off. For example, let's take arrogance. Why would a person become arrogant? Babies aren't inherently born arrogant. I don't think I've ever heard anybody look at a baby and say, this is really, he's really arrogant or she is really arrogant. That's not how babies are born. But what happens is when these babies mature and they start becoming fixated on themselves, that makes them arrogant. So for example, they might think, I have a certain amount of beauty, and that makes me arrogant. Because I'm thinking about myself. I'm comparing myself against everybody else. And I'm looking, I look beautiful, I keep looking in the mirror. And I look at everybody else and put everybody else down. Or maybe a person has a certain amount of education. And like I've said, shared many times before, you find any high school students are all shaking in their boots. You find a college student, they're shaking in their boots. People who are taking their board exams are shaking in their boots. All of a sudden, the ones that pass the boards, they forget about, the fact that they were shaking in their boots and they start looking down upon others. Because they think, I have a certain amount of knowledge. I am so smart. I got this job. I make this much money. I know, and these people don't know. I'm the one that knows, I'm, you know, a great manager and I know how to manage this and that. These people don't, that's why they're a failure. What's happening in all these cases? What's happening in these cases is the person is just doing more and more and more, they cut off themselves. And the more they do, they cut off themselves. The more they pump themselves up full of air and the more arrogant and considered, they become. It's simply just the, the, the, the, the vicar of the self. Person looks at other, person looks at their possessions. They say, I have this, other people don't. I have this kind of car. I have this kind of house. I have this bank balance. I have these types of clothes. And it's those things that, that cause a person to become arrogant. Otherwise, a baby comes out of the womb. They have nothing to be arrogant about. They came without any clothes, without any house, with any of these possessions. It wasn't inherent within them. Sure, there might have been a propensity within them, like there isn't within every human being. But nobody's going to call it baby arrogant. Until they learn to do the vicar of themselves. And as they do the vicar of themselves, particularly when they begin to compare with the world around them, that pumps them up, pumps them up, pumps them up, pumps them up, until they become these really considered arrogant people. We all have a little bit of, within us. So, that's, this is a battle between what? It's a battle between the vicar of themselves, versus the vicar of Allah. Now, SubhanAllah, it's very interesting. What does the Quran tell us about the reality of our status, and circumstances? What is the Quran say? Wa ma bi qum min n'er matin min Allah. Wa ma bi qum min n'er matin min Allah. And whatever you have, wa wa ma bi qum min n'er matin min Allah. And whatever you have, from any blessing, from min Allah, it is from Allah. So, what are we being, what is the Quran, or what is the Dean reminding us? The Dean is reminding us that, whatever you think you have, pause and recognize that it is only from Allah. And that's the type of vicar. So, maybe I have some beauty, but that's given to me by Allah. Maybe I have some wealth, but that was given to me by Allah. Maybe I have some academic prowess, or I'm a good trader, or a good businessman, or a good architect, or a good engineer, or a good lawyer, a good physician, whatever it might be, but that's all from Allah. So, Islam is reminding us that, rather than do the vicar of yourself, you need to remember that all these blessings are from Allah. And you should be doing the vicar, or we should be doing the vicar of Allah. And that is the cure to that disease. What's the cure to pride in arrogance? The cure to pride in arrogance is to remember that everything only comes from Allah, which comes through the vicar of Allah. If a person simply gets back to that state, then it's very, very difficult to remain pride in arrogance. This is why you'll hear the scholars say that all these diseases of the heart do more vicar, do more vicar, and do more vicar of Allah, do more vicar of Allah. And avoid the vicar of the dunya. The more you sit around, the more we sit around people, and keep talking about ourselves, or keep talking about something that, something that the group deems to be relevant, the more that embeds itself within our heart. For example, you'll see people, they want a job. They want a job that are firm. Let's say they want a job at some firm. I don't know. McKinsey, Boston Consulting Group. So what do they want? They want some job at this firm. And how do they get that idea in their mind? It wasn't like embedded in them genetically. They're sitting with one another, and they're talking it up. Oh my God, I got this job. If you get this job and this job and this job and this job, and then it gets to the point where they're so caught up in that world, that when they don't get the job, they're like devastated and in tears because they wanted that specific job. And then you have a conversation with them and you say, but okay, you didn't get that job. Aren't there another like 5,000 opportunities out there? Why are you so fixated on this job? No, I just wanted this job. I don't know why Allah didn't give me this job. I made so much doah. I made so much doah. I gave so much South Africa. No, you didn't make doah. You didn't give South Africa. You were just thinking about yourself. You gave South Africa, but you were thinking about yourself. You weren't thinking about Allah. You gave South Africa because you wanted the job, not because you wanted the pleasure of Allah. You made doah because you wanted the job, not because you were truly seeking what was best for you, breath for you from Allah. You didn't get it. It's okay. But no, the person is like, in tears broken. Doesn't know if they can come back to the muster again. Doesn't know what's going to happen with their deen. Literally telling me, I don't know, I'm losing my deen about what? It's just because the person was not doing the vikot of Allah that we're doing the vikot of themselves. This is a very, very dangerous thing. These diseases of the heart, right? And this complaints that we have about our status and circumstance in life. And when something doesn't go our way, we become all happy, puffy and upset. It's vast majority of this is arising because we're doing the vikot of ourselves. Even when it's wrapped up in the vikot of Allah. Even when we wrap it up in the vikot of Allah, like I said, we say, I'm making doah, I'm making doah, I'm making doah, but we're not really turning to Allah. We're really just asking for what we wanted. And if we don't get it, we're all upset. So, sure, we should always ask Allah's final teller for everything. But the ask from Allah's final teller should be, Ya Allah, I think this is good for me. I think this job is good for me. I think this marriage is good for me. I think this investment is good for me. But I have no knowledge only you know. And I don't decree only you decree. And I don't want anything except your pleasure. So, if this is good for me, give it to me. And if it's not good for me, just get rid of it from me because I don't care about it, I care about you, Ya Allah. That's a completely different attitude. It's a completely different attitude. People come to me and say, I'm doing so much, you don't know how much is tohara. I did, I want to marry this one person. It's not a tohara. That's not a tohara. That's you imposing your will on Allah's final teller, Ya Allah. You're telling Allah what should happen through this masquerade of is tohara. I don't care what dream you had, you see, you were on the beach and the wind was blowing and all this. I get the most interesting stories of Allah. I make them up myself too, we're all human beings. The point here is that look, everybody's doing the kar. But the Muslim learns to do the true the kar of Allah for the sake of Allah because they want Allah's pleasure, because they want to avoid Allah's displeasure. Otherwise, it's just the thicket of the self. And so, upon all, like I'm saying here, I'm trying to establish a spectrum. One spectrum, one edge of the spectrum is the vast majority of humanity which basically 365 days a year, 24 hours a day, is just doing the thicket of themselves. We're am I going to have breakfast? What am I going to wear today? What are people going to say about me? How can I fulfill each and every one of my desires? And the world plays to their song. They're on that, they're dancing to that tune. That's one extreme. And then there's the opposite extreme. By the way, this extreme is the people who are doing the thicket of themselves. Then there's the opposite extreme. Those are the people who are doing the thicket of Allah. The people who are doing the thicket of Allah are pursuing Allah for the sake of Allah with their tongue, with their hearts, with their minds. And then you got these people in the middle, that's us. There's these people in the middle. They know they should be here, but half the time they're back here. And then they wrap it up and this is snow. So they wrap it up in all these halal food options. They wrap it up in this is the heart of what they really want. They wrap it up in Islamic financing. The question when all these things are here, the way we talk and the way we live is, are we really just doing the thicket of ourselves, wrapping it up in some sort of like pretty wrapping paper? Or are we really doing the thicket of Allah where we are seeking the pleasure of Allah and not our own pleasures? There's a difference. And that's the challenge of every Muslim. To understand the spectrum. And to ask themselves, where do I fall in that spectrum? And when am I, how can I get myself to truly do the remembrance of Allah? And the test, by the way, the test is in what happens in life. Like I said, I gave you the example. A person wants a job or wants a residency or wants a marriage. And they're Muslim, they're good Muslim. And then they come crying saying, or they cry for a while, come crying. They're like in tears because my house offered it and go through. In tears because my job offer didn't happen. But the question is like I said earlier, the question is, why are you in tears? If the tears are being driven by the remembrance of Allah, then we should actually be, these should be tears of joy. Why are the tears of joy? Because I've hummed Allah, I tried to marry this person. And the fact that it didn't work out is a sign that Allah blessed me. Because I would have made a big mistake and it didn't happen. So I'm so happy. I made a Sahara and I asked Allah to guide me to what's best. And he took this away from me. So this is a sign that Allah has blessed me and took it taken me away from a path that I was headed in. So these are tears of joy. The people who are doing the vicaromal lot, they're shedding tears of joy. Ya Allah, thank you so much. I was blinded. I thought I wanted this thing. I thought I needed this thing. I thought this was what was best for me. It didn't happen after I made dua. And this is the Sahara of the Lord of the world. Or there's the tears of self. The tears of broken self. Say in Muslim, making a Sahara and making dua, then comes and says, I can't believe it. I can't believe it. I can't believe that I was making dua to Allah. I can't believe that I made a Sahara and this didn't happen. I don't know. I'm having questions now in my mind. That was not dua, that was not a Sahara. That was just an expression of my vicar of myself. I want this marriage, I want this job, I want this career, I want this residency, I want this house on the zillow. It's all me. It's all me. So look, the tears are the same. But what's driving the tears? What's driving the tears? Is it me and my broken desires that's now causing me to cry at the most silly thing? I understand it's not so silly when you're in the middle of it, but silly in the greater reality of the scheme of reality. Or is what's driving my tears? The remembrance and the true vicar of Allah. So this is the spectrum. And hummed on it, we're not at this far off spectrum. We even have no clue, we're just every day just trying to pursue our desires and wondering how the world conserves me. Because that's one extreme. But we have to get to this extreme, which is everything is only for the sake of Allah. Everything is constantly for the sake of Allah. And sure, where are we permitted to do vicar of ourselves? We're permitted to do vicar of ourselves when it comes to our needs. For example, I need to eat two meals a day, whatever biologically however much I need to eat. Then I can do the vicar of myself and say, where am I going to get this meal from? But even in the context of that vicar, I still have to ask the question, is this halal and is this meal pleasing to Allah? There is some room for the vicar of the self, but it's very, very tightly regulated by the deen. And the sunnah is even more tight. You know, minimize the food that you eat, minimize the possessions of this life, minimize the pursuits, seek just what you need and move on. Be in this world as a traveler. Be in this world as a traveler. So, this is a spectrum of vicar. Everybody on the planet is always in a state of vicar. The question isn't, are you in a state of vicar? The question is, are you in a state of vicar of yourself? Or are you in a state of vicar of Allah? And this is what every Muslim is being challenged with. And Subhanallah, the beauty of this deen, is that it reminds us to be in continuous vicar of the state of vicar. And through the continuous vicar of Allah, it frees us from the shackle of our desires and allows us to be able to disengage from the deception of this dunya. May Allah SWT make us among those who are continuous in our vicar of Allah. May He protect us from being absorbed in the vicar of ourselves. And may He protect us from all the diseases that arise when we become fixated on our own lives. And in the end of the day, Allah SWT.
