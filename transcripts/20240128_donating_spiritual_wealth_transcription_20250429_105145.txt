For example, there are some Doas that the Prophetphshoo liked to make at the time of waking, or at the time of sleeping, or at the time of eating, نراك على المواصبي optimization أداء الأصابق أو السماء

تجدًّ prezoceوا وا pigeons horizons املعا تو bear شخص thatís فيهاмерها الواقع kamp was the various الأبد point of the prophe值ferت the beginning of the day and the beginning of the night و because this period is the beginning of the as I was reviewing and putting together my thoughts I also began to think that like this also is the beginning of the night even though we meet on a Sunday at Melvittor but it's technically the beginning of the night so it might be a good habit to on occasion present some of those as well along with the thicker that we do so that all of us can get in the habit of making those dohas and we put together admittedly I think you have to remember that when one companion is bringing one doha another companion is relating another doha a third companion is relating a third doha so if you put them all together it becomes many but what we did was we selected a very simple easy sequence of those dohas and each one kind of covering a theme I think that that whole sequence doesn't take more than perhaps three to five minutes to recite and it's something that we should be in the habit of doing every morning and every evening because there's lots of benefits associated with it so the reason that I took this pause here and by the way the reason this is also dominant over my we just finished a retreat if I look tired that's why I don't I actually can't even pick up my hand but we just finished a 36 hour retreat this morning and one of the features of that retreat was that we also went through that booklet and the brothers there were also reviewing that booklet with us so anyway I just wanted to get it pulled up on the screen but maybe it's a little complex so what we'll do is just to introduce this notion and make sure that we all embed this in our routine but by the way let me just also establish that the best the best the best the good is always the the good that's established by this one and by the way every line that's in our routine that we do once a week each of these has some established basis in the Sunnah or it's from the Quran as you see sometimes on the screen but anyway I mean in the time of the morning the time of the evening etc it's always best to embed the Sunnah Sunnah on our routines so I don't know if we can get it on the screen and I was hoping we could just run it together in three minutes five minutes however long it takes but since we don't have it let's at least just do one together and in the future we'll add over time and I'll just recite it and everyone can recite it over me I really can recite it with me but let me just introduce it so the first one and by the way the sequence is arbitrary the problem is I said I didn't say do this and do this and do this and do this he simply just introduced a series of things that can be shared or recited at that at the time of the beginning of the evening so the first of these do-az which again is also in the booklet is called the greatest is the Qfar and why it's termed the greatest is the Qfar oh Subhanallah that is good timing I should have said take us to Jannah okay anyway I'm there a lot so the greatest is the Qfar essentially we take in the booklet we labeled the heading for this chapter the greatest is the Qfar and the reason we labeled it the greatest is the Qfar is because the prophet s ice on them said that this is the best way by which a person can seek forgiveness of Allah Subhanallah to Allah but there is no greatest there is no greater mechanism of more superior prayer for seeking forgiveness than this prayer and in particular the prophet s ice on them specified by the way this entire narration is in the book of Imam Bukhari okay in particular the prophet s ice on them specified that the individual who recites this with conviction that if they happen to pass away if they recite it in the morning and they happen to pass away anywhere anywhere from the morning until the evening they will be a person of paradise and the person who recites this with conviction in the evening if they happen to pass away before the morning they too will be a person of paradise so you can see this is a great mechanism that we should embed within our routines because literally in about 30 seconds we can set ourselves to enter paradise and essentially what this does is remember that what is the benefit of is the Qfar is the Qfar just returns us to our base level think if you think about it just from a one angle you're born with jannah you don't have to earn jannah you're born with jannah right I mean a child essentially dies they're in jannah so jannah is actually ours it's a birth right I said this before but it's like if you study American history they say we hold these rights to be inalienable we hold these rights to be fundamental to man that you have this right and that right you know and anyway in our dean you're you're you're essentially given jannah this is Allah's gift to all of us that were given jannah and we then simply have to maintain it and the mechanism by which we maintained it is to just remain pure we purify ourselves ourselves from shirk purify ourselves from qufar purify ourselves from sin purify ourselves from diseases of the heart purify ourselves from certain manners and this basically enters us in jannah all we're doing is really purifying ourselves so this one the prophesies and them says that the individual who recites this in the morning and then if they happen to pass away by the evening they go to jannah the reason is because this is such a powerful shower that it just washes away all of the sins of a person now of course if we have sins in which we wronged another person then we have to make up for those but I mean like I said a few weeks ago here I think you're not planning to go rob a bank after you're in the muskah right the presumption is that you're taking care of the major sins and that we as Muslims don't run around trying to perpetrate major sins but essentially we're caught up in minor sins consistently and these minor sins get washed away by this type of a stick far so we should be in the habit of reciting this every evening and every morning and it's very simple and it's very quick but it provides lots of benefits so let's do it together I'll put it on the screen I didn't know we'd have it on the screen I'll put it on the screen we're recited together Allahumma antah rabbi la ilaha illa ant colak tani wa anabduq wa ana ala ahndika wa waadika masta tata aawwubika min sharri maa sanakdu abu ulaka mini amatika alayya wa abu ulaka بذمبي بوغفرلي but innahu la yofiul dunul inla ant so this is just a one of a handful of doas that should be recited I think in our in a little booklet we put together we put seven of these so seven times 30 seconds is not much you know you're talking about again three to four minutes some of them are even shorter than i'm not going to do the rest of these we'll do these slowly over time but i just want you to recognize that these this type of this time of the day provides a very unique opportunity and like i mentioned in shayAllah we will once the book is printed or if you wait two days it'll be on the website you can download it and you can actually just begin to practice some of these basic اثقار as well in shayAllah okay lost khan wa'ta wa habistos countless countless blessings upon us and those blessings generally come with a responsibility we can't make the presumption that the reason the blessings come is because we're being rewarded for example for person says that i've been given all these blessings but the reason that i've been giving these blessings is because i'm being rewarded then that is a type of deception because actually this is not a place of reward this world is a place of test and sure when a person does good Allah spanot al-abistos good upon them but the purpose of the benefits and blessings that we're given is not to celebrate the purpose of the benefits and blessings that we're given is actually to expose or express the fact that Allah spanot al-abistos is the one who provided these and that we recognize that these are not the goal but rather these are mechanism to achieve Allah which is the goal now this deception arises very often in our society because we happen to be blessed with abundance and we somehow come up with the mistaken notion that this is our opportunity to pamper ourselves rather than our opportunity to to attain and earn the jannah that Allah has given us the opportunity to attain through these blessings now first point first is that what do you mean you're going to be asked about whatever blessings you were given well let's just go back for a minute there's many ways we can prove this but we can go back to a very very well-known incident that will occur on the day of judgment and all of you are aware of it but perhaps you haven't thought of it from this angle but everybody has heard the famous incident where you know some of the earliest people to go into the hellfire will be those people who will be brought for Allah in particular the example of a person is given will be a person who will be brought before Allah spanot al-abistos and will have been a scholar but will have been a scholar for the sake of gaining fame or will have been a Qadi but will have been a Qadi for the sake of gaining fame or will have been a Mujahid but will have engaged in jihad for the sake of being called brave now all three of these people who are given as examples in this narration that I'm referring to which all of you have heard before and essentially what happens with each of these people is that they make a claim that the reason I became a scholar was for the sake of the Dean or the reader or I became a scholar I became a Qadi I became a Mujahid and essentially it's established on the day of judgment that the reason that they did that was not for the sake of Allah but rather the reason that they did that was for their own name, fame, glory etc whatever it might be so this I think is well known and the lesson that we all take from this is that the purpose of what we do should never be anything except the pleasure of Allah we're not doing what we do in order to gain people's attention if I give a donation at the Mujahid the reason for giving the donation is not so that people can appreciate me and put a plaque on the wall the reason for giving the donation is because I am more in need of giving than the Mujahid is of receiving so there's a completely different attitude that the Muslim has because they are not focused on themselves they are focused on the opportunity and their need to connect with Allah's panel with Allah but take a step back and the reason I raised this narration is that in each of these instances if you go through that narration a little more carefully in each of the instances what happens it's described that the initial state is described and it's specifically mentioned on each instance that the person is said you were given x, y, and z blessing so what did you do with it you were given x, y, and z blessing so what did you do with it now let's go back to this pick one example you were given x, y, and z blessing so what did you do with it I became a scholar well but you became a scholar so that people would call you a scholar so go and ask them for your reward but here your result is going to be jahannum right so notice that the whole scenario that you're very aware of it's initiated by the question what did you do with your blessings how did you reciprocate the blessings that were besowed upon us or how did we reciprocate the blessings that were besowed upon us so we have to ask the hard question before we're asked that day right we have to ask that hard question what are we doing with the blessings that Allah has besowed upon us and how we're reciprocating the fact that He gave us those blessings every blessing comes with a responsibility to think that somehow we're being showered with a reward is actually thinking that we're in jannah when we're not in jannah we're in this world this world is a place of test which means that each responsibility is not a reward it is really a test asking the question what do you do with this given that Allah has besowed this upon you so we have to be exceedingly careful to understand this point now all of us recognize this and perhaps we best recognize this in the context of the wealth that Allah has besowed upon us and we all know that the wealth that Allah bestows upon us is really just an opportunity for us to be able to spend in order to earn or at least attain I should say in order to attain His blessings so that we can get into jannah this is a key criteria of the wealth that we've been given and we should be very clear about this the purpose of our wealth is to liberate ourselves it's our opportunity each person is given their own unique key by which they can un-bind themselves from the shackles that they shackles of their mistakes and their sins our unique opportunity if we happen to be blessed with wealth is to spend that wealth in the name of Allah and ironically and interestingly the spending of the wealth in the name of Allah never decreases wealth although it feels like that externally outwardly it appears to be that I'm decreasing my wealth we know two things number one if we give from the wealth of Allah Allah will increase us in this world but there is no such thing as emptying our account except that Allah refills it and number two that every wealth that we give in this world every penny that we give in this world will be captured by Allah and will be all that remains because what we spend on ourselves will never benefit us in the hereafter what we spend on ourselves will not benefit us in the hereafter what actually is saved what actually remains of our wealth is that which we spend on others because that's what allows us to be able to maintain it in the hereafter so this is the general premise with wealth and all of us know that and honestly it's a it's a daily challenge because this is the biggest deception you know we're very attached to wealth by nature and we're very we we make lots of justifications in our mind as to why we've been given this wealth and why we deserve this wealth and I worked hard and I'm so smart and I'm such a good Muslim so this is why you know we make all these ideas and we create all these scenarios in our mind and paint these pictures in our mind as to why we should be spending on ourselves and not on others but I mean this premise is exceedingly clear sometimes it's hard to hear but it's exceedingly clear everyone knows that we've talked about it before I want to take it one step further today and I want to say that it's not just the physical wealth that is a responsibility but there's another type of wealth that hamd al-Ala hamd al-Ala we've been given and that wealth is the wealth of our dean and this wealth of dean also carries a responsibility when a person is given the blessing of dean it doesn't mean that they can revel and celebrate in their experience of dean without having a concern about ensuring that they do what they can to share that dean it's like any other wealth if I said to you hey you have a thousand dollars in your bank account what's the best way to increase that thousand dollars and maintain the blessings of that thousand dollars we would all say I should give a percentage of it in in in Sadlaka I should share it with others I should seek those in need and I should present it to them that will benefit me by increasing my wealth by bringing more baraka into my wealth and by preserving my wealth both in this world and in the hereafter the same is true however the same is true however of the blessing that Allah has bestowed us with which is our dean the dean is a type of wealth and every one of us has this wealth because you're sitting in this messaged and the fact that we're sitting in the messaged is not because I'm some special guy or some special gal or because I've done something unique and I'm so talented so this is why Allah's Allah put me in the messaged no there's great talented people out in the world far more talented than any of us in this room yet Allah gave us it made us trillionsaires not billionaires trillions and trillions is an underestimation I can't use a word I don't have a word in the English language to express what this blessing of dean is but if we've been given this blessing of dean it's not so that we can sit and just not worry about the rest of the world and not worry about the people around and just think that somehow all I have to do is revel in my blessing and not worry about anyone around me no if we've been given this wealth of dean it's like any other wealth it carries responsibility and that responsibility it includes making sure that we spend some of it in the benefit of others no to think that I have to be a scholar in order to benefit others would be the same like thinking I have to be a millionaire before I'm going to donate sometimes people create this false notion in their head they say that you know I can't do anything I'm just a simple guy how am I supposed to benefit others I don't know anything about I know very little about my dean to begin with but I would go back a step and say do you need to be a millionaire to donate no if you have a half a date seed you have half a date a pit of a date or half a date donate it donate some of it because Allah's Allah will give you the benefit of that even if it isn't a large amount sometimes even just the smallest amount can provide a great benefit so that excuses out the window every one of us should be just okay let me put it this way just like every one of us works in order to maximize the wealth that we have and should be working to maximize the wealth that we donate in the same way and every one of us should maximize the dean that we have but also needs to maximize the amount that we donate and I mean the amount of the dean that we donate now what do I mean by that what do you mean donate the dean how am I supposed to go out there I'm not running on must year I don't get to sit in front of the the the member no that's not the way that the dean has to be very shared let me ask you a simple question in your wealth what's your first sphere of responsibility it's automatically what's the first sphere of responsibility with the wealth it's the family right if you take care of your family then the community becomes stronger because nobody else in the community has to take care of your family in fact it's very frowned upon if look you're not permitted to go give wealth and then leave your family hungry correct you're not permitted to go give wealth and leave your family hungry but why is it that how would you how would we think that we're permitted to go and do every worry about everybody else's dean but leave our family empty it's the same it's the same thing the first sphere of responsibility in our physical wealth is our families and the first sphere of responsibility in our spiritual wealth is our families as well and we have a primary responsibility to ensure that we bring dean into the home now dean into the home doesn't mean that you turn the home into a mother set because you'll have the whole house run away from you dean in the home just means to bring Allah the remembrance basic remembrance of Allah the basic principles of purity the basic essence of the dean that all of us have in our lives to bring that into the home as well now how can that occur that can occur by ensuring that we spend time first of all it starts by spending time in the home i was reading one of the scholars was writing that he was very frustrated this is 100 years ago 100 years ago one of scholars writing he said i feel so frustrated that people leave their home to spread the dean but they don't even do anything in their home to share the the dean and so finalized true it's true so each of us bears a responsibility which is to establish and share the dean in our homes now what does it mean share the dean in the home look once a week every one of us should gather the family together to gather the family together for 10 minutes for 10 minutes and maybe you pick some book that is simple again you don't want to get too detailed right you just want general principles because you can't impose on people you have to have wisdom so you want to do this you want to give the same dollar that the prophesies home would give right which is here's the basics of this dean so every week maybe five minutes 10 minutes seven minutes you tell the family in advance look a seven o'clock on Thursdays we as a family are going to sit together and you know there's five of us this week you're going to say something about the greatness of Allah next week you're going to say something about the seerah next week i'm going to say something about some aspect of the dean or maybe you say we have this book i'll read a paragraph today everybody can say what they felt next week we'll read another paragraph doesn't even need to be anything major it's not what you say that matters in those gatherings it's the fact that you turn to Allah and cared it's that much just to show Allah's panwaratullah that we care that we recognize that we have been given this blessing and that this blessing isn't going to be maintained by me apunting the responsibility to the musjid to the Imam to the sunday school and to the full-time mislaw miks school that's secondary those things are but look as a person who has responsibility sitting in this seat i don't have access to your to certain people in your family maybe i get a chance to speak to you i'm not going to get a chance to speak to every member of your family you have access to your family now it was acceptable although that scholar is complaining a hundred years ago in my mind i was thinking he's complaining is in the indian subcontinent why is he complaining about this it's a minor issue at that time why because okay if the family if the if the part the head of the family didn't take the responsibility then at least there's a layer of protection because the whole society is Muslim the school is Muslim the teachers are Muslim all the people in the surround you are Muslim so if i fail then at least they'll be the the the children or the next generation will be will be saved by a series of safety nets but there are no safety nets here we're in the middle of how we ended up where we're in the middle of this place right if if my safety net is out the next step is very dangerous so if every person were simply to just take this responsibility of doing something really basic with their family now again i'm not talking about like imposing deep thick on the family people thick it's not something you impose on people thick is something that comes naturally when you love a law you love his messenger to lie sometimes you want to figure out how to attain you it's a secondary it arises secondarily you sit if you sit with the kids and tell them you guys are wasting your time on your phone you guys are wasting this tiktok is haram this and that and then listen anything you have to say all you did was break the connection but look if you spend every day after school an hour with your kids doing homework and you talk nothing about Dean just you spend an hour with your kids doing homework every day now what happens you bought a connection do i really care about physics and my my child learns physics maybe not but if i'm sitting with my child and teaching and working with them on physics i have another goal in mind which is like hey this is a way i can communicate with them i'm developing a connection with them i'm going to use that it's i'm earning capital i'm going to spend that capital one day one day when i have something to say i spent six months talking to you about this this this one day when i have something to say from my own heart i'm going to it's going to be much more likely that they're going to listen so we have to spend time with the families we can't just like ignore the families and go off and i'm sitting and eating in a restaurant i'm sitting with my friends and chatting because my house is so frustrating i can't deal with anybody in the house if we can't deal with anybody in the house it's not the house's fault it's our fault honestly it's just a reflection of what's inside of us it's not a problem with the with the house that everybody's a gone a ryan the house so i'm going to run away and go someplace else no this is my primary responsibility i can't just escape and drop it and just go then who's going to take care of it nobody's going to take care of it because there's no other role a line of defense here every one of us in this room the mother's fathers and children have a responsibility for the family we have to spend time with the children and we had children you don't just have them and they just grow up by themselves it's a responsibility and we're going to be asked about this responsibility you're not going to be asked about some house you know 40 miles away from here you think on the day of judgment a lot of time i was going to ask me what's happening to the family in bowling brook no first question is going to be me second question is going to be my family i have a responsibility towards my family so i have to spend time investing in them and that means that i have to put time in it doesn't just happen you know it's not going to just happen magically now the dean has certain requirements and i have certain things that i need to do and i'm not saying that we can't do the extra things but we can't forget about the fact that we have a responsibility and honestly the strength of the community doesn't come from the strength of the Imam and the muskid or some mother or some group of people it comes every community's foundations it's always the family it's always the family each family is a building block that forms a community if every single person were simply to take care of their family we'd be done the community would be elevated a whole layer so quickly i gave this example over the retreat i was speaking about this topic and one of the things that we talked about in the retreat was that there's studies that are done that show like how many people you normally collect connect with socially so i don't put social media aside the social media is its own beast but just if you ask the question a normal human what is their domain of connection and the domain of connection is about 150 people okay so every person has a domain of about 150 people now my immediate domain and sphere of influences who my immediate domain and sphere of influences my kids my spouse my immediate family but then i also have a domain of influence beyond that for example i have cousins i have ants i have uncles i have nephews that's a big amount you you really feel that when you make the wedding invitations right people make the wedding list is oh my god we got 200 family members how are we going to fit anybody else here it's very common people say i've got 150 family members this whole hall is already full now home i'm supposed to invite but that 150 family members that's an opportunity for every one of us if if look very simple calculation just for a second let's do a very simple calculation there's a hundred people sitting here okay if these hundred people have a sphere of influence of a hundred people each how many is that multiply it quickly 10,000 maybe we have to sit and do homework together 10,000 100 times 100 is 10,000 am i doing it correctly we're a scientist 10,000 so it means that in this gathering alone the ability to affect 10,000 people is present if you scale that's called scaling right where one person touches another set of people this is how the internet works you send it to one person date you send it to your 100 people they send it to their hundred people and you start with one piece of garbage and it spreads throughout the whole world okay this is exactly how the internet works it's it's scaling but this is how the dean works to in the sense that it scales you have one message or so i send them he presents it to a group of companions the group of companions go out and spread this to each of the people that they have influence over and over time this thing scales until you become a billion people right so panola it starts with one man but it starts with one sincere man who cared who cared enough about his community initially the prophesies on this doubt i began with just his family members and eventually it begins and it spreads throughout his tribe and then the people of the courage and then from the people of the creation it spreads beyond it does it it's spread it's scaling it's scaling it's scaling scaling until it becomes who we are today but we are who we are today because somebody cared beforehand right for example you know you say oh it was easy in the back in the good old days one chief converts and the whole tribe follows but the one just a harder question why did why does the whole tribe follow why does the whole tribe follow the whole tribe follows because that chief built connections that chief of the tribe the head of the tribe develops connections with people there's family connections there's different bonds that have arisen over time and that bonds and connections gives them some degree of of of influence over that that sphere of people so if we don't for example here if you're the chief if i'm the chief of the family and i never make a connection with anybody in the house right because i don't care i just want to tell you about the dean i don't want to do anything else i don't want to deal with anything else it's just going to give you a lecture about dean whenever i open my mouth i have built no connection with the people so how can i influence the people in the home we have to be invested in the home we have to participate in the things that apparently seem very very trivial but they're not trivial because they connect you with another person it's a good thing to spend time with the kids doing their homework it's a good thing to ask the kids how their day was it's a good thing to talk to the people in the house even though it might seem like to you like this is a waste of time i got bigger and bigger bigger and better fish to fry i got to go read my book in the corner i've got to go do my thufsi i've got this important friend that i have to meet somewhere and have food with but but but then how do you develop a kid how if you don't have a connection how are we going to develop a sphere of influence so every single person in this room has been given a certain degree of wealth and by wealth here i mean the wealth of the dean but to share that wealth requires an investment it requires that we develop connections with one another it requires that we talk to people about what they want to speak about i'm not saying we have to do anything how wrong but where's their where is there the harm in asking how your day was where is there the harm in asking what do you have for homework today where is there the harm for asking do you want to go do this right but if we don't spend any time and then people come to me and i get this every day that's why i'm so heated about it i get this every day my family is upside down i'm doing all this great work nobody in the house is praying is not the house's fault is the chief's fault fine in some occasions some occasions i understand that you know you work and work and work and you're sincere and good-hearted and it doesn't work your way somehow i'll attest you and you know that this particular person in the family it happens to go off and need some time before they return i agree that that happens but that's not the primary diagnosis it is a diagnosis it's a possible it's on the differential of diagnosis sorry i'm talking medicine it's on the differential it's on the possible list of diagnoses but it's not the primary diagnosis it's not the most common diagnosis the most common diagnosis that we failed is chiefs i got no connection with my kids i got no connection with the people at home i don't have enough time to talk to my neighbor so now how am i supposed to influence them well when it comes to a song i want to tell you god is one and the Muhammad is his messenger so i said them what are they going to listen to us that's not the way human beings function you have to have a connection with them you have to understand them you have to communicate with them they have to have a bond with you and then at the right time at the right moment you have the ability to be able to share this important message so very important that every single one of us handle our own domain the Imam in the musk can not handle all the family problems the Imam in the musk is not going to be able to clean about people come all the time they bring you big bring you the subject at the end degree they they bring the family member or they bring a person that this person doesn't pray this person doesn't this this person then this can you sign them up for hiffs this person's this this this i want to do you have any space in the Islamic school this person's gone way is straight i think they should go in this month or so is there any room for admission that's a that's like a complete shirking of our response complete denial of our responsibility and now we want to like try to solve it at the end hour by just putting them in this environment i'm do not like set the intention at least we care that much male or less one other will make that a mechanism by which we can uplift our families but the responsibility primarily falls on us in this society especially there it falls on us we have to invest time spend with our children we have to build connections we have to build bonds we have to connect with every member of our family we have to call the people in our family to see how they're doing and then what happens is that silent connection slowly begins to infuse some goodness within the people and that inshallah will lead to a great degree of advancement of the community now what happens is in the context of that if you ask the Imam and the musk in the context of that if you ask the Imam of the musk to give a lecture it's so much easier for the Imam and the musk to be able to uplift the entire community because now they just have to do small little touch ups they don't have to like try to carry every single person's family on their shoulder which is never possible by the way so again the summary long winded with the summary here is that Allah has blessed us with Dean Allah has blessed us with Dean it's a great blessing but it carries a responsibility as well it carries a responsibility and that responsibility is that we have to share it and it's through the sharing of it that will be able to grow it develop it increase it advance it but in order to share it don't forget that it needs to occur in the in a backdrop of trust it needs to occur in a backdrop of relationship with others and it's when we have that type of relationship when we build that type of capital between one another that we're able to then eventually make our claim and present with wisdom what we're trying to achieve and it's far more likely for that to lead to the the establishment of Dean in the homes then just assuming that it's arbitrarily going to occur and then cursing everybody in the family when it doesn't this is not the way the world works again i'm not saying we shouldn't do the good things that we do yes we should take the time to do the things that are important to us we should advance in our dean we should make contributions to the community around us we should take responsibility on our shoulders those are all important things but we should always keep in mind that we have a primary responsibility of the family and the moment we have a family that means that we have a responsibility towards that family when i'm home i should be home i should be participating i should be an active member of the family the professor i sent them when he was at home i showed all the Allah on on her describes what was he like at home he was actively participating in the home he's like you know stitching things literally stitching things at home now if i walk in the door i'm so tired i put my feet up on the couch and i say everybody where's my food where's my dish where's my that i'm not participating in the home you're just a king who walked in the door that's not participating in the home participating in the home is to get up and say hey what's going on in the house how can i make a contribution what can i do to make the entire family unit move one step forward that creates capital that creates trust that creates an opportunity for perhaps maybe a few months down the road to be able to share a piece of guidance but that requires effort as well and this is a responsibility that falls upon all of our shoulders and again if we don't do it i don't know what will happen 20 years from now you know 20 years from now anything can happen you see what's happening in the community today you see how families are disintegrating you see how people literally are leaving the dean you see how much confusion there is how much chaos there is over and over and over over over again i'm getting these calls i'm talking to people people are telling me their stories it's everywhere it's everywhere and it doesn't mean that there isn't hope it just means that we have to double down on our efforts it's even more important for every person in this room to give time and attention to their family it's even more important for everybody in this room to be involved with their family people you know our children i'm not going to be able to do the thicker because i've three minutes so let me just finish here our children when they go out into the world they should see the stark contrast of the purity of the home versus everything else it should not even be a comparison they should see that my home was pure and i don't find that purity anywhere else when i hang around with these people i see that they're drinking i see that they're swearing i see that they're fighting i see that they're backbiting i didn't see any of that in my home it's such a stark contrast that they just want to return home that should be the environment of the home but that environment to have that type of environment in the home requires an investment it means that everybody's putting in their time particularly the the mother and the father they have they're they're the primary people that are responsible for this and we all carry that responsibility now if the home even if there was minimal deen in the home but there was just this degree of purity and cooperation in the home that's sufficient to act as a counterbalance to the options that are present outside because the options that are present outside they don't compare to Islam at all it's like the sun in the moon Islam is so high so pure so great that even the tiniest bit of it distinguishes darkness from light so it should be clear to like our children when they go outside into the world that they don't find what was in their home in any other place they don't find what's in the mustard in any other place and that's why it's so important even in the mustard gotta be a place of purity a place of goodness a place of a positive message a place where they feel welcome where every person feels welcome where they don't feel judged you walk in the door and everybody's judging you you don't if you want to come back the next time we all come to sinners we don't come to judge allows the judge we're we're just a bunch of sinners coming to the laundry everybody brings their dirty clothes to the laundry this is just a laundry man so I mean all of these things they should they should they create an environment that protects us and protects our deen but anyway I went on so many tangents the simple summary again is that Allah Subhanallah has blessed us with this deen and that this blessing carries a responsibility and as part of that responsibility we have to spend uh with to spend on others and by spending on others here I mean taking the time to develop the connections so that we can deliver the message that we want to deliver even if it's silent and by the way the silent message is way stronger than anything ever said you just create a positive home environment the children will look and say why was it that way without saying a word because I represent Islam they see prayer they see the sunnah they don't need to you don't need to give them any kind of like calculus here it'll be it'll be dead obvious to them but if we don't invest the time we're never around we don't participate every time we're home it's war there's it's a food fight going on constantly what are they going to say they're going to say the outside world looks so much better than what's here and even worse I go to the muskid I hear all these positive things but I never see it on the Muslims that I interact with which let's say in this case would be my family members so we should take this responsibility very seriously because these are our families and this is our next generation it's our own homes it's what we'll be asked about it's our next generation and it's our opportunity to be able to expand our own thing because it's in the context of a good strong family that we can then comfortably go out and handle the rest of the world that that's what allows us to be able to focus on all the other things that we need to do once I know that my family's tucked away they're in good shape they're in mind is good I mean imagine if your family's hungry how can you go out and enjoy anything else right we wouldn't be able to if the family's hungry and starving you're never going to be able to enjoy all the other bounties of the world but if the family's hungry and starving of Dean how are we going to be able to go out and take advantage of all the other opportunities that Allah has presented to us so we have to invest time in our families each of us needs to spend the time take the energy to have the care have the concern regularly engage with the family for a certain period of time and on occasion deliver the message that we hope to deliver vis-à-vis the sake of Allah's panatala and the Dean again may Allah's panatala make us amongst those who are able to appreciate all of the great bounties and blessings that he's bestowed upon us and may may make us amongst those who are able to develop tight relations with each of our family members and may may make us amongst those who are able to share this Dean with each of the people that we engage with wa al-khurat-a-wanah anil hamd al-illahi r-r-bala alamin
