And it's those organs that allow the human being to function within the society in which it exists. In fact, you can even scratch away further and underneath the organs you're going to find cells. Underneath the cells you're going to find complex organelles. You're going to find a nucleus, you're going to scratch away at the nucleus, you're going to find DNA, you scratch away at the DNA. You find other molecules that are essential to maintain an organism. My point here being is that just because you superficially see a human being doesn't mean that you understand the essence of that human being. There's layers to human beings and when you scratch away at those layers, then you begin to understand the essence or the reality of that human being. And this is true for so many things. For example, if you go into nature and you look at nature, you're mesmerized by all the human beings. And you're all of the symphony that exists in the world around us. But if you scratch away at that and you go beyond that, you eventually recognize that all of these pieces could not have come together except that there is a creator that put them together. And eventually you come to a reality that Allah's panawat ala is the one who is actually in control of all. You can come to that reality from multiple directions. You come to that reality even when you look at ourselves, we scratch away at ourselves, we see organs, we see those organs, we see cells underneath those cells, you see the organization, each layer that you scratch at you see the organization, but eventually you come to a reality. And it's when you understand the reality of something that you can appreciate its depths. Now one reality regarding us is a physical reality, which I briefly mentioned, which is that you scratch away at the body and you eventually underneath, you pick up organs and it's those organs that allow human being to function. And it's when you understand the organs, then you can optimize a human being. You can look at their heart rate, you can look at what's going on in their blood, you can look at whatever, how much oxygen and how much carbon dioxide, how much oxygen they take it, take in how much carbon dioxide they really stirring exercise, etc. That's the physical aspect of a human being, but it's important for us to also appreciate that along with our physical reality, we also have a spiritual reality. And that this spiritual reality, until we understand it, it's very difficult for us to be able to optimize what we're trying to be. So let me take a step back, human beings, me and you, or you and I are all composed of a body and a soul. And only if we understand that we're composed of a body and a soul, will we be able to appreciate our greater reality. For example, we have a body and a soul and just as the body needs to be fed, so too does the soul need to be fed. These two components of us, they exist in a constant struggle, you can think of it that way. If the body becomes dominant over a person, then the person essentially becomes animalistic. If you look at a person who's consumed with their bodily functions and features, then essentially they become very similar to an animal. What does an animal do? An animal pursues its food, it pursues its shelter, and it pursues its reproduction. And you see this, if we emphasize the body, which is the same as an animal, then we essentially become very similar to animals, or we call it animalistic. Now the opposite extreme, or the other side of us, maybe I should say the other side of the coin, is that we have a soul. And if we limit the body and sustain the soul, or nourish the soul, more than sustaining, nourish the soul, that allows the soul to grow. And if the soul grows, then a human being becomes, you can say, angelic. What is angelic? Angelic means that they become submissive to Allah, Spanelat ala, and in the state of the remembrance of Allah, they become mesmerized by Allah. So every human being is in this balance, is in this flux. Every human being is in this flux. There's a body, and there's a soul. And either people are emphasizing their body, which is the vast majority of creation, or they're emphasizing their soul. And again, a person who emphasizes their body becomes animalistic, and a person who emphasizes their soul becomes angelic. And it's in this spectrum that all of us exist, and this is where our challenge lies. Now to be able to appreciate our goal, we have to appreciate, or to be able to appreciate this reality, we have to appreciate that we're made up of a body and a soul, with the scratch beneath the surface of who we are. And that's one perspective. Now, like I said, if the body requires nourishment, and all of us understand that, in fact, from the day we're born, everyone's focused on that body and its nourishment. For example, when a baby's born, one of the first things I ask is, how much did this baby weigh? Nobody's looking at the weight of the soul, everybody's looking at the weight of the body. How much is the first thing? How tall was this baby? How much did this baby weigh? And then every few weeks or months thereafter, where is this baby on the weight percentile? How much has this baby grown? How much does this baby now weigh? What is this baby eating? Does this baby have a balanced diet, etc., etc., etc.? This is essentially the emphasis on, this is the type of emphasis that we have on the body, even from the day that we're born. Then, as a baby develops and becomes a child, it becomes adolescent, it becomes a teenager, it becomes an adult. Still, there's tremendous emphasis on the body. There's emphasis on what the person wears, there's emphasis on how the person looks, there's emphasis on how the person dresses, there's emphasis on how where the person eventually will live, who are they standing next to in their photographs, etc., this is the solid emphasis on the body. And all this energy is put into feeding and growing the body. But at the same time, we have a soul. And the food of the soul, as the remembrance of Allah, is the deen, is the Qur'an, is the Sunnah, is the good deeds that we do. All of these things are the food of the soul. And the food of the soul is required for the soul to grow. So one very, very simple principle that we can gain when we just scratch the surface of who we are and understand that we have a body and a soul, is to appreciate that, just as we have a body and a soul, we have a responsibility to feed the body, but we also have a greater responsibility to feed the soul. Another dimension of the body and the soul is that the body and the soul are constantly at a tug of war regarding our state of remembrance. It's a little bit subtle, so I'm going to go through this a bit slowly. The body and the soul are constantly at a tug of war regarding our state of remembrance. To understand this, let me start by just saying, I've said this before, but I'm just repeating this today, that everybody on the planet is in a state of the kar. And by Vikar, let's just translate this broadly as remembrance. Every single person on the planet is in a state of Vikar, in a state of remembrance. The question isn't whether people are doing Vikar or remembrance. The question is, what are they doing Vikar of? A little subtle, so you have to pay attention here. Again, what am I saying? I'm saying that every single person on the planet is in a state of Vikar. The question isn't whether people are doing Vikar, every person on this planet is doing Vikar. The question is, what are they doing Vikar of? Are they doing Vikar of the body or are they doing Vikar of their soul? Let me just elucidate or explain this just a little further. From one extreme, there are people who are doing Vikar of the body. What does that mean? Essentially, they're doing Vikar of themselves in relation to their body. For example, if a person is remembering themselves in their body, then they are doing Vikar of the body. They're seeking out the different pleasures of the body and constantly asking the question, how they can want up with that pleasure or maintain that pleasure. If somebody wakes up in the morning and says, I want coffee. The type of Vikar, they're remembering themselves in their desire for coffee. Now, they come up with a plan that I'm not going to get just this coffee. But I want that coffee from that place with this much sugar, this much cream. It's a very, very intricate type of remembrance. And it motivates and drives them to get out of bed, to start their car, to fast until they get to that place where they can get that exact coffee. They really will drive past four or five places of coffee, to wait in line, even though the coffee is not available, to take out their hard earned money from their pocket, to pay for that coffee, and then to slowly consume that coffee and enjoy that coffee. Now, what caused a person to be able to do all of those steps? They're doing Vikar of their body. They're doing Vikar of themselves, essentially. This is what I want. Now, as soon as the coffee is in them, they're thinking of the next step. I want to do this, or I want that. And it drives them, and it moves them throughout their day. This is essentially what's driving human beings. Nobody's just waking up in the morning and just empty. They're remembering something. There's something that's driving their remembrance. You'll see people will say, you know, oh, there's a new... I don't know. There's a new hamburger place, or pizza place, whatever it might be. And people will drive past one, deep pizza places in order to get to that specific place. So what's driving them? It's not the fact that they're just trying to feed the body, because they pass so many places on the way. What's driving them to make those sacrifices and go all the way to the other side of town is the fact that they're doing some type of Vikar. It's not a Vikar in that way. It's a remembrance. They're remembering their body and their desires, and that's driving them to excel, quote-unquote, excel, in making sure that they achieve the best coffee, the best pizza, the best entertainment, the best fashion, the best car, the best house, whatever it might be. But when we engage in that, or when anybody engages in that, essentially they're doing Vikar, but they're doing Vikar of themselves, these are either their body. There's no person on the planet that doesn't do some type of Vikar in that way. Our challenge is to scratch beyond the body, to scratch beyond the surface of the body, and to appreciate that this body is just... We've just been placed in this body as a test. The goal isn't to allow the Vikar of the body's desires to take over us, so that it drives us in everything that we do. It drives us to wake up in the morning. It drives us from point A to point B. It drives us from point B to point C. It drives all the goals that we have in life. It puts us to bed at night because we're so tired of entertaining ourselves that we just pass out on our pillows. We have to crack beyond that. We have to see the reality of the body. We shouldn't be driven by the body. We should appreciate that the body... We've been placed in the body as a test. Isn't that exactly what this is? This life is a test. As part of this test, Allah's Panwatullah has placed us in this shell called a body. The reality of us is not this body. The reality of us is the soul. We've been placed in the shell of the body, essentially it's a cage. And it cages us with its desires. The body wants to eat. The body wants to reproduce. The body wants to be entertained. These are all part of the desires of a human being, the part of the body of a human being. This is the whole test. The soul doesn't care about these things. The soul is high. It's elevated. It wants to connect with its creator. It's the body that holds us down. So now we're trapped in this body as if it's a jail. And part of the test is that this body has desires. And all these things are planted in the world around us. And the challenges, whether we pursue the desires of the body, or whether we crack and go beyond, scratch beyond the surface of the desires of the body, and appreciate the opportunities of the soul. And what are the opportunities of the soul? The opportunities of the soul are to connect with its creator. That's the ultimate opportunity of the soul. And if a person can see beyond all of these desires of the body, then they can get past the vicar of me, myself, and I, and how am I going to entertain my body today. And they can get past that, and they can elevate themselves by doing the vicar of the soul, which is essentially the remembrance of Allah's panel at all. So the challenge isn't vicar. Everyone on the planet is doing vicar. The challenges, are we doing the vicar of the body? Meaning are we constantly engaged with the body, remembering our desires and pursuing our desires, which basically makes us what? Makes us animalistic. And you can see the very, very extremes of that and how they exist in our society today. Or do we see past that? Do we appreciate the realities of this body? Do we appreciate that this body is a cage, it's a jail, it's meant to test us? And do we look beyond those desires that are present within us? Do we reduce those desires that are present within us? And instead, do we pursue the true opportunity, which is the opportunity, to connect the soul with Allah's panel at the Al-Ala, and which is really the test that we have been placed in as we are present in this life today? All of life is a test, and all of the tests around us are tests of the body. When, I mean, you look at the things that the aden prohibits, it's prohibiting, basically, it's prohibiting issues related to the body. It's prohibiting us to look at certain things, it's prohibiting us to eat certain things, it's prohibiting us to pursue certain things. These are all the pleasures of the body. And this is all just essentially a big test. So, simple message for today is to just appreciate the bigger picture of where we are. We have two components. We have a body, and this body has its desires. And we have a soul, and this soul has its opportunities. The desires of the body, if they're pursued and they're made the primary purpose of our existence, then we become no different than the animals that are present around us. The animals are driven by their desires. They're driven by the desire to eat A, B, and C. They're driven by the desire to do X, Y, and Z. They're driven by the desire to mate and reproduce. That's what drives animals. And if we emphasize the body and make that the primary purpose of our existence, then we essentially become animalistic. But there's a greater reality to human beings, which is the essence of a human being, which is the soul. And in order to get to the state where we attain the opportunity of the soul, we have to get past the body. We can't be caught up in the remembrance of the body. It can't be that we wake up in the morning and we're driven by what we're going to eat. Honestly, even when a person sees the world from the lens of Islam, they still fail to appreciate this greater reality and get even trapped within that. So instead of the average person waking up in the morning and saying, I'm going to be driven by my desire to eat this or to go here or to do this, the average Muslim will wake up in the morning and they're still driven by the same desires, but they just label it differently. I'm going to have my coffee, but it's going to be a some Islamic place with an Islamic name. I'm going to have my food, but it's going to be some halal food, which I'm going to have to drive far for, you know, think about all day and finally get myself to. It's still a remembrance of the body, it's still an emphasis on the body. The opportunity of the body doesn't mean that we don't eat and it doesn't enjoy the world that's part of our existence. It's okay, but if this becomes the purpose of our existence, like every weekend I'm just desiring to pursue the next opportunity to eat, pursue the next opportunity to entertain myself, whether I call that halal or haram, it becomes a fun, it becomes a focus on the body that turns us into animals, and turns us into people who are doing the remembrance of the dunya around us. The reality of the essence of us, the reality of the opportunity is an opportunity of the soul, but in order to be able to become angelic, which is the opportunity that exists with the soul, we have to connect the soul with Allah's panel, which means that we have to get past the body. It doesn't mean that we negate the body, but you have to get past the body, and what you're going to find in the Sunnah is not some sort of mechanism to legitimize the desires of the body in an Islamic way. That's not the Sunnah, to legitimize the desires of the body in an Islamic way is not the Sunnah. The Sunnah is to limit the desires of the body, not to fill oneself with halal food, but to limit the amount of halal food. Halal food is an issue of halal and haram, but there's another layer to it. The layer of the Sunnah is to limit the halal food, to limit the entertainment, to limit the desires of the body, even when permissible. Why? Because the body is a cage. The more we pursue our desires, the more we become animalistic, the more we become tied down by the body, and if we're tied down by the body, we can never elevate the soul. A simple test for you and I is to ask one question, which I've mentioned dozens of times before, which is to simply ask the question, when do we feel most spiritual? When do we actually connect with Allah? Obviously, we connect most with Allah during the month of Ramadan. Why are we connecting with Allah's panel at the end of the month of Ramadan? Because we're de-emphasizing the body. The more we de-emphasize the body, the easier it is for the soul to be ignited in the passion of Allah's panel, the love of Allah and the remembrance of Allah. This is inherent to the soul. You don't have to do much. You just simply have to reduce the body to its proper balance with the soul. And it's so easy to achieve because literally you can achieve it in 20 days. I know it's difficult if you had to like outside of the context of Ramadan, actually fast for 20 days. But if I said to you that the whole essence of a human being can be reset in days, you know, somebody comes to you and says, I'm completely off balance, you can say the whole essence of a human being can be reset in days. It's not a decades-long endeavor. It's not even a years-long endeavor. It's simply a days-long endeavor. In a few days, of course, in the context of the Baraka of Ramadan. But in a few days, a person's body can be reduced to the size that it should be, or at least closer to the size that it should be, and create the space for the soul to be elevated. That's why we experience Ramadan. That's why we experience Islam so uniquely in the month of Ramadan. Obviously, there's other issues I've given a talk on this separately about thinking about the case study of Ramadan and how we can take so much benefit from the month and how we can apply those same principles outside. But again, one feature of that is what? Is that in the month of Ramadan, we get the opportunity, albeit we're assigned it, but we get the opportunity to be able to limit the soul, sorry, limit the body, and when we limit the body, the soul inherently grows. So here again, you're seeing the same dynamic at play, which is that we are human beings. We're comprised of a body and a soul. The body is a jail. It's a chain. It's handcuffs. It reduces our ability to be able to take advantage of the true opportunity, which is to connect the soul with what's beyond created. To connect the soul with Allah's panellatah Allah. But it will never ever happen. It's not possible. It's not possible that the body is super emphasized, and the soul is somehow going to have an experience. It's not possible. The soul needs space. There's a tiny box. The body and the soul, they exist in a box. If the body is emphasized, even in Halal way, if the body is emphasized, everything we wake up every morning and all we think about is, what's my coffee, what's my breakfast, what's my lunch, what's my dinner, how am I going to entertain myself after work? What am I going to, where, etc., etc.? Even when Halal, it's still going to give so much emphasis to the body that there will be no space for the soul. If we truly want to experience the Dean, it comes by bringing these two things in balance. By scratching away at the surface of the human being and recognizing that the human being actually is composed of a body and a soul. The body has its needs. The Dean teaches us that the body has its needs. The vehicle must be maintained. It must be put in a certain circumstance that allow us to go from birth to death, but it has to be de-emphasized, not emphasized. It has to be de-emphasized. The more it's de-emphasized, the more it's limited, the more it's restricted, the greater the space for the soul, and the greater the spiritual experience. Like I said, just a few minutes ago, everybody on the planet is doing the go. Either they're doing the go of themselves, and it drives them to go from pizza place to coffee shop to entertainment to work, to the zillow to wherever they go. And you can see the energy and excitement that people have in it. This is what causes the world to turn around. This is what drives every economy, particularly in the Western countries. Or people are doing the go of the soul. And the go of the soul is obviously the go of Allah, and the connection of the soul with Allah, is panawat ala. And when a person reaches that state, then what wakes them up in the morning is prayer. What drives them to the midday is an opportunity to again engage with Allah in vaher, what they look forward to as Asa. They look forward to Mughra, they look forward to Asa, they look forward to the opportunities that they have to be able to serve Allah in His Dean, to be able to take Allah's name on their blessed tongue. All of these are the things that drive them. Now we can ask ourselves the question, where do we find ourselves on the spectrum? Particularly, this is a very specific address to the people in the masjid here, because you've come for the gathering of Vikr. But particularly, if we want to achieve what we claim that we seek, then we should appreciate that it's not going to happen through all this emphasis of the body. It's not going to happen because every weekend we find a new Halaul place that we can feed ourselves. It's not going to elevate ourselves spiritually and create some sort of spiritual experience. It's a permissible experience. It will allow a person to be able to fulfill the functions of the body and continue on with their life, but it's certainly not going to lead to a spiritual experience. I'm going to allow we should just remember that Allah's Panwata Allah has created us and has designed, has created us and we contain two components, a body and a soul. And our goal is to free ourselves from the shackles of the body, so that we can see the true opportunities of the soul. And that will all become apparent on the day of death, because on the day of death the body will have ended and then we'll appreciate all of the opportunities that were present for the soul. Like we say that the opportunity of the soul is not to consume, but rather to share. And that's exactly what happens at death. We wish that we would have given our fair share of Saddaka, because that was the true opportunity not to consume for ourselves, but rather to ensure that we share with others. May Allah's Panwata Allah allow us to be able to appreciate the reality of our existence. May Allah's Panwata Allah allow us to be able to overlook the desires of the body and instead to be able to elevate our souls. May Allah's mercy and mercy be upon Allah.
